         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have often wondred at ſome Prelatiſts, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the poore non-conformiſts with deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of things indifferent; from which their Writings do ſufficiently acquit them: Dr <hi>John Burgeſs (in his Rejoinder, Pag.</hi> 188, 189.) tells us, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> againſt all Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſenſe, reſolves, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indifferent. But from this accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have Dr <hi>Ames</hi> his Vindication (<hi>in his freſh ſuite againſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, pag.</hi> 161, 162.) Dr <hi>Hammond (in his grounds of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity)</hi> accuſeth <hi>Ameſius</hi> himſelfe for this opinion; but with how little truth, the Reader may ſoone ſee, if he pleaſe to peruſe theſe following places in him, <hi>Med Theolog. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 13, 14, 15. <hi>De Conſcientiâ &amp;c. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> informes me, that one of the Articles of <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> (anathematized in the Councill of Conſtance) was, that <hi>nulla ſunt opera indifferentia.</hi> That which Papiſts of old charged upon him, theſe men impute to thoſe, whom they have been pleaſed to nickname Puritan's. But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102374:4"/>for the untruth, and injuſtice of this crimination, we dare appeale to the more moderate, and Learned of their own party. The Reverend, and Learned Dr <hi>Sanderſon</hi> diſputeth againſt them, for making the reſtraint of the outward man in matters indifferent, an impeachment to Chriſtian liberty; on <hi>Rom:</hi> 14.3. <hi>Pag.</hi> 24.25. And this preſuppoſeth that they held ſomethings to be in their nature indifferent. I ſhall therefore ſpend no more time, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to wipe off an aſperſion ſo manifeſtly untrue, and unjuſt: But yet however this hath occaſioned me to reſolve upon the briefe ſtating of the truth touching things, or actions indifferent: and in order hereunto I ſhall 1. Premiſe ſome <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the actions of man; and 2. <hi>Explaine</hi> what is meant by indifferency.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The actions of man are either <hi>indeliberate</hi> or <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Indeliberate,</hi> which proceed, either from the <hi>diſpoſition of naturall qualities</hi> (as hungering, thirſting, the eaſing and disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of nature) or elſe from the <hi>force of Imagination,</hi> (as rubbing of the beard, or hand, ſcratching of the head, lifting up of a ſtraw from the ground, and ſuch like things, when a man thinks not of them.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Deliberate,</hi> which proceed from deliberate reaſon and are properly humane, and rationall actions, all voluntary actions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe may be conſidered two manner of waies. 1. <hi>In the generall, actu ſignato.</hi> 2. <hi>In the ſingulars, and individual's, actu exercito.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>former</hi> conſideration is meerly in regard of the object; The <hi>latter</hi> taketh in all circumſtances whatſoever: The <hi>former</hi> is a conſideration of actions, <hi>ſecundum ſpeciem,</hi> according to their <hi>ſort or kind;</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> is a conſideration of them in regard of their <hi>actuall exiſtence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a <hi>ſecond</hi> place we are to enquire, what is meant by the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of actions: It apparently carrieth in its notion, a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morall goodneſſe, and illneſſe:</hi> I ſay, <hi>ſig nantèr,</hi> of morall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and illneſſe; becauſe the moſt indifferent actions are <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ntly,</hi> and may be <hi>naturally</hi> good. <hi>An indifferent action then is that, which is neither morally good, nor evill:</hi> The nature of things indifferent, (<hi>ſaith the great Hooker in his Eccleſiaſt. Policie,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102374:4"/>Pag.</hi> 59.) is <hi>neither to be commanded, nor forbidden, but left free, and arbitrary:</hi> With which I would deſire Dr <hi>Hammond</hi> to reconcile what he hath in his Treatiſe of Will-worſhip; <hi>that the beſt of morall actions, the higheſt degrees of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall here onely make uſe of part of his expreſſions againſt <hi>Ames (in his grounds of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, Pag.</hi> 14.) He that thinks the higheſt degree of vertue is indifferent, doth certainly uſe <hi>other</hi> Dictionaries then we doe. But to leave him, I ſhall for clearing the nature of indifferency propound, and ſatisfie <hi>two Queries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. What <hi>medium</hi> indifferent things are betwixt things <hi>morally good,</hi> and <hi>evill?</hi> whether <hi>medium abnegationis,</hi> or <hi>participationis?</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Altare Damaſcenum</hi> affirmeth it to be medium <hi>or a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between</hi> them by way of <hi>abnegation, Adiaphora non ſunt media per participationem, ut rubedo inter album, &amp; nigrum; ſed per negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem utriúſque extremi, conformitatis &amp; difformitatis ad rectam ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ſeu legem,</hi> pag. 496.</p>

                     <hi>Capreolus,</hi> that a thing may be ſaid to be a medium, or middle betwixt that which is morally good, and morally evill; either by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102374:5"/>way of <hi>abſtraction</hi> from them (as a generall nature is abſtracted from it's differences, a ſubject from it's accidents,) or elſe by way of <hi>repugnancy</hi> unto them, becauſe it is uncapable of them; and thus a ſtone is of a middle nature betwixt that which ſeeth, and is blind; becauſe it is uncapable of both ſight, and blindneſſe. Now it is this latter way, that a thing is ſaid to be a medium by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation of each extreame, as is evident by the inſtances uſually brought for the exemplification hereof; For they are of ſuch things as are uncapable of, and repugnant unto both extreames. And the moſt indifferent actions, that proceed from deliberate reaſon, are capable of becoming either good, or evill, by circumſtances, and carry no repugnancy thereunto: ſo much is confeſſed by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doclave</hi> himſelfe in the place above mentioned. <hi>Tertium quod conſtituit hujus medii formale eſt non repugnantia ad utrunque extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum. Actus homicidii in bove cornu-peta nullam habet conformita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, aut difformitatem adrectam rationem, non tamen dicitur actus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differens, quia ibi eſt repugnantia ad utrunque extremum, nam bos eſt animal irrationale. Adiaphora igitur ſunt dubia, indiſtincta, &amp;</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRÓQUE <hi>vergentia, ſed non magis vergentia in unum quam alterum extremum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others therefore conclude, that indifferent actions are a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or middle betwixt good, and bad, in a way of <hi>participation;</hi> and that either <hi>potentiall,</hi> or <hi>actuall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Potentiall,</hi> There is in them a non-repugnancy unto either of the extreames, unto morall goodneſſe or badneſſe, ſo that they may be either good, or bad by circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Actuall,</hi> and this agreeth onely to ſuch indifferent acts, as become good by circumſtances; for they being but imperfectly good, are in part good, and in part evill, and ſo partake actually of both extreames. By this you may ſee, though indifferent actions, which proceed from deliberate reaſon may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be a medium of participation betwixt that which is morally good, or evill; yet they are not ſaid to be a middle of participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuch a <hi>ſtrict ſenſe,</hi> as lukewarmneſſe is betwixt cold, and heat; for that alwaies partaketh actually of both extreames (cold, and heat,) whereas indifferent actions doe not alwaies actually partake of the two extreames, (morall goodneſſe or badneſſe,) but onely when they are good; for many of them may be, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102374:5"/>too often are by circumſtances <hi>totally</hi> and altogether evill, and in <hi>no reſpect</hi> good. <hi>Ameſius</hi> qualifies the matter, and affirmeth that as it is not <hi>medium merae abnegationis,</hi> ſo it is medium <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cujus participationis,</hi> a middle not of meere abnegation, but of ſome participation. Abſolutely, and ſimply, in ſtrictneſſe of ſpeech, it is neither <hi>medium negationis,</hi> nor <hi>participationis:</hi> 1. Not <hi>negationis;</hi> becauſe it hath no repugnancy unto it's extreames: 2. Not <hi>participationis;</hi> becauſe it doth not <hi>allwaies actually</hi> partake of both extreames; But yet, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a ſort, and in ſome reſpect, it may be reduced unto both <hi>medium abnegationis,</hi> and <hi>participationis:</hi> It reſembleth <hi>medium abnegationis,</hi> becauſe <hi>as ſuch</hi> it is neither of the extreames; and it reſembleth <hi>medium participationis,</hi> becauſe ſometimes it <hi>actually</hi> participates of both extreames: And thus you ſee how theſe different opinions may be reconciled; But yet (becauſe <hi>denominatio fit à potiori</hi>) we ſhall rather reduce it unto <hi>medium participationis;</hi> becauſe unto that it hath the greateſt reſemblance.</p>

                     <hi>A ſecond</hi> queſtion is; Whether all indifferent actions be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent? no more bending unto evill, then unto good? <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doclave</hi> holds the affirmative, <hi>Nec ſolum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>requiritur ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio conformitatis, ſeu difformitatis ad legem ceu rectam rationem, ſed etiam majoris propenſionis in unam quam in aliam partem.</hi> And againe afterwards: <hi>Adiaphora non ſunt magis vergentia in unum quam alterum extremum.</hi> The incomparably Learned Dr <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is of a contrary opinion, that ſome things are <hi>unequally</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>Indifferentia ad unum</hi> (as he is pleaſed to call them) I ſhall tranſcribe his words, and with all due reverence of his perſon briefely examine them.</p>

                     <hi>Things unequally indifferent are ſuch, as though they be neither univerſally good, not abſolutely evill, yet even barely conſidered, ſway more, or leſſe rather the one way, then the other: And that either unto good, or unto evill. Of the former ſort are ſuch outward actions, as being in morall precepts indefinitely commanded, are yet ſometimes ſinfully and ill done: as, giving an almes, hearing a ſermon, repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102374:6"/>actions, as being in morall precepts indefinitely prohibited, are yet in ſome caſes lawfull, and may be well done: as, ſwearing an oath, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling on the Sabbath day, playing for money, and the like: which are in themſelves rather evill, then good, becauſe they are ever evill, unleſſe all circumſtances concurre to make them good. Now of theſe actions, though the former ſort carry the face of good, the latter of evill; yet in very truth both ſorts are indifferent. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand me aright: I do not meane indifferent,</hi> indifferentiâ contradictionis, <hi>ſuch as may be indifferently either done, or not done; but indifferent onely</hi> indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ contrarietatis, <hi>ſuch as (ſuppoſe the doing) may be indifferently either good, or evill: becauſe ſo they may be done, as to be good, and ſo they may be done alſo, as to be evill; but yet with this difference, that thoſe former, though indifferent, and in ſome caſes evill, are yet of themſelves notably and eminently inclined unto good rather then evill; and theſe latter proportionably unto evill, rather then good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>anſwere:</hi> The firſt ſort of actions, ſuch as being in morall precepts indefinitely commanded, are yet ſometimes ſinfully and ill done, (as, giving an almes, hearing a ſermon, reproving an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and the like,) are not in the language of the Schoolmen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions: This I ſhall make good by an argument out of <hi>Suarez</hi> (brought by him unto another purpoſe;) He diſputing againſt ſome, that held all humane actions to be indifferent, proves the contrary; Firſt in <hi>inward,</hi> then in <hi>outward actions:</hi> and his argument concerning outward actions ſtands thus. If ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall acts be conſidered according to an objective goodneſſe, or illneſſe, this cannot be true, becauſe there are many actions in their own nature objectively evill, and prohibited, and there are other alſo objectively good, and honeſt; becauſe this goodneſſe, and illneſſe is not taken by extrinſick Denomination, from the inward act, but from it's intrinſecall agreement with, or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy unto right reaſon. Thoſe actions which have a <hi>materiall, and objective</hi> goodneſſe, are not indifferent actions in the language of the Schooles. But the actions, that the Doctor ſpeaks of, have an objective, and materiall goodneſſe, becauſe they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and therefore they are not indifferent. But, ſaith the Doctor, they are indifferent at leaſt <hi>indifferentiâ Contrarietatis,</hi> 
                     <q>ſuch as (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the doing) may be indifferently either good or evill: becauſe ſo they may be done, as to be good, and ſo they may be done alſo, as to be evill.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102374:6"/>
                  <p>For <hi>anſwer:</hi> By this account all outward ordinances of God, all externall acts of worſhip, and indeed all outward good works whatſoever ſhould be actions indifferent, becauſe they may be done well, or ill: But to ſay that all theſe are indifferent would be very ſtrange language: for although they may have evill caſt upon them externally by the agent, yet this is no hinderance but that they may be in themſelves <hi>objectively</hi> and <hi>materially good,</hi> as being matter of precept.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps there may be ſome myſtery in this clauſe, <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely commanded:</hi> They are commanded, but not to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alwaies, but only <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>anſwer:</hi> This will nothing alter the caſe; for hereby it will follow, that the matter of all affirmative precepts ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; And whoſoever ſhall ſay ſo takes indifferency in a different notion from the uſuall acception thereof by both Papiſts, and Proteſtants; who jointly make it to be a middle thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that morall goodneſſe, and badneſſe, which is called <hi>objective</hi> or <hi>materiall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> of Actions, I readily confeſſe that in ſome ſenſe they may be ſaid to be unequally indifferent, inclining and ſwaying more to evill, then to good. To cleare which I ſhall diſtinguiſh of a <hi>twofold conſideration</hi> of ſuch actions: They may be conſidered <hi>meerly in regard of their object,</hi> or elſe alſo in regard of the <hi>circumſtances, which uſually are annexed with them:</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their <hi>object</hi> they are equally indifferent; But yet in regard of <hi>Circumſtances</hi> may be ſaid to be more notably and eminently inclined unto evill then unto good; becauſe the circumſtances, which generally, and commonly are connexed with them, are evill.</p>
                  <p>But as for the reaſon, which the Doctor bringeth to prove them to be unequally indifferent, rather evill, then good, is to me very unſatisfying. His words are, <hi>which are in themſelves rather evill, then good, becauſe they are ever evill, unleſſe all circumſtances concurre to make them good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground of my exception againſt this reaſon is, becauſe as much may be ſaid of all outward good works, religious duties, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102374:7"/>ſervices whatſoever: They are all ever evill, unleſſe all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances concurre to make them good, according to that of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius, Bonum fit ex cauſâ integrâ malum ex quovis defectu.</hi> I ſhall conclude my anſwer unto this ſecond <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In their own intrinſecall nature they differ nothing at all: but yet there are ſome which for the moſt part have evill circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances annexed to them, and ſo bend more toward evill, and have an evill name: as to do the worke of an accuſer, the office of an hangman, &amp;c. ſome there be alſo which for the moſt part have good circumſtances, and ſo bend toward good, and have a good name, as to till the ground, to follow our ſtudy diligently &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall in the next place, proceed to lay downe ſome concluſions concerning the indifferency of the actions of man: and they ſhall be three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The Indeliberate actions of man which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the diſpoſition of naturall qualities, or onely from the Imagination, as to rub the beard, or hands, to ſcratch the head, to move the head, feet, or a ſtaffe (The mind being not intent upon them,) may be, and are indifferent, <hi>not onely in the generall, but in their individuals,</hi> and <hi>ſingulars:</hi> The reaſon which

                     <hi>Aquinas</hi> giveth for this is very ſolid; Becauſe ſuch actions to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly are not morall, and humane, for they do not proceed from the ſoule as reaſonable: Thoſe actions, which are not morall, or of morall conſideration, are uncapable of morall goodneſſe or bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for morall goodneſſe, or badneſſe implieth a morall beeing: But now thoſe actions which proceed from the diſpoſition of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall qualities, or from the force of the Imagination onely are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102374:7"/>not morall, are not of morall conſideration, they are <hi>extra genus moris:</hi> And the reaſon is becauſe actions have their morality from this, that they are ſome way or other immediately, or mediately derived from reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this reaſon of Aquinas,

                     <hi>Durand</hi> propounds this following objection: that if the acts of the imagination be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a morall being, and ſo not of a morall conſideration, that then they are uncapable of ſinne: for every ſinfull action is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall action: But now they are not uncapable of ſinne: for it is moſt evident, that <hi>in ſenſualitate poteſt eſſe peccatum,</hi> that ſin may be in the indeliberate acts of the ſenſitive appetite, and in the acts of the imagination; and the reaſon is, becauſe the ſenſuall powers or faculties are ſaid to belong or appertaine unto reaſon, though not <hi>eſſentialiter,</hi> yet <hi>participativè,</hi> as being under the conduct and guidance of right reaſon, obliged to hearken unto it's voyce, and to obey all it's juſt Commands, and dictates.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>anſwere</hi> here-unto in the ſame Author is, that the <hi>indelibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> acts of the ſenſitive powers, and faculties are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>But now there are ſome indeliberate acts of the ſenſitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have not for their obiects the <hi>matter of ſinne,</hi> ſuch as are above inſtanced in, and of them we may ſay indefinitely, and in the <hi>generall,</hi> that they are not morall; becauſe they are not voluntary, either <hi>directly, or indirectly;</hi> Reaſon is not bound to

As when they are a hinderance to Duties, or againſt that decency which is required in the worſhip, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; As for example if a man ſhould be rubbing of his beard, ſcratching of his head, moving of his feete, or any other part of his body in an undecent way in the act of receiving the elements in the Lords ſupper: That which I have ſaid touching this Concluſion is for the ſubſtance of it in <hi>Ames de Conſcientià. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.

                  <p n="1">1. There be ſome actions, which though they be actions of man, yet they are not humane actions, ſuch are thoſe which proceed from imagination only, and not from deliberate reaſon, as the rubbings of mens hands, to ſcratch the head or beard, to take up a ſtraw, &amp;c. while we are thinking of ſomething elſe: theſe actions are not morally good or evill, they want that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make them ſo, namely counſell and deliberation: for although a man may ſin by thoſe actions, as if in time of prayer he ſuffer his imagination to wander, and do give way to ſuch toyings as thoſe. Yet theſe actions conſidered in themſelves are neither good nor evill. It is true theſe motions are ſubject to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of mans will, but yet they are ſo ſubject, that they may be exerciſed without any precedent act of reaſon; neither are we

                     <hi>Others</hi> in the next place look for the cohaeſion of theſe words for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon the Apoſtles enſuing diſcourſ, touching fornication: not only the Corinthians, but the Gentiles in generall held ſimple for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a thing indifferent. The old man in the <hi>Comedian,</hi> ſpake the ſenſe of the generality of them: <hi>Crede mihi non eſt ſlagitium ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcentulum ſcortari.</hi> And you will the leſs wonder at this, if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that <hi>Durand,</hi> a Popiſh Schoolman, held it to be unlawfull, not by the law of nature, but only by the poſitive law of God: <hi>Quod autem dicunt quidam, quod ſimplex fornicatio eſt peccatum mortale de ſe, excluſâ omni lege poſitivâ, divinâ &amp; humanâ, non benè intelligo, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 33. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 2. And upon the Conſideration of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gentiles touching the indifferency of fornication it was, (think interpreters,) that fornication is Acts. 15. by the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ranged amongſt indifferent things, bloud, and things ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled; The uſe of which was forbidden onely for a time. Unto this erroneous ſuppoſition the Apoſtle anſwereth <hi>per limitationom, &amp; per inficiationem:</hi> He <hi>limits</hi> the generall rule touching things indifferent, and then he <hi>denieth</hi> the inſtance in queſtion; And this his denyall he <hi>illuſtrateth,</hi> and <hi>confirmeth</hi> from <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>unto the end of the chapter.</hi> Unto this his deniall he premifeth limitations of the generall rule. <hi>All indifferent things are lawfull:</hi> He puts a double reſtraint upon it. <hi>The firſt; But all things are not expedient, or profitable:</hi> Many indifferent things ſometimes prove an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment unto our Chriſtian race, and then they are to be forborne. <hi>A ſecond</hi> reſtraint is in theſe words: <hi>But I will not be brought under the power of any:</hi> My affection unto indifferent things ſhall be ſo temperate, as that it ſhall be in my power to forbeare them upon reaſonable and important Conſiderations. There ſhould be an indifferencie in our deſires towards things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo that they ſhould not have the command of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we ſhould be able to uſe, or not to uſe them, as the concurrence of particular circumſtances guide us.</p>
                  <p>To give yet further light unto theſe words, I ſhall briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their coherence as they lie in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. with little vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The Apoſtle there ſtates a caſe of Conſcience touching the eating of Idolothytes, things offered unto Idoles. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he reſolves, that to eat them publiquely in the temple of Idoles, at the idolatrous feaſts of theſe Idoles, was to have communion in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102374:10"/>worſhip of theſe idols to have fellowſhip with Divels; to be partakers of the table of Divels: He that did thus eat them, did eat them conſidered <hi>formally,</hi> as ſacrificed and conſecrated to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles; He did eat them in the honour of the idols, unto which they were offered; He did <hi>tacitly</hi> acknowledg their Deity, and <hi>interpretatively</hi> approve of the Idolatrous worſhip and ſervice of them; But now the Apoſtle alloweth a private uſe of things offered to idols, If they were not eaten under a religious notion, but conſidered onely and <hi>materially</hi> as meat, matter of food, and as the good creatures of God. <hi>Two caſes</hi> he inſtanceth in, wherein they might be thus eaten; <hi>Firſt,</hi> they might buy them in the ſhambles, and eat them in their own houſes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they might eat them at the tables of their unbelieving neighbours, that invited them: This latter part of the Determination of the queſtion he confirmes, and limiteth, by putting in an exception in the caſe of ſcandall: And unto all this he prefixeth the extenſion of our Chriſtian liberty, unto all indifferent things in the generall, together with two reſtrictions, that we are to put upon it in <hi>the uſe</hi> and exerciſe: Even indifferent things are to be forborne, <hi>when</hi> they are not profitable, and conducing unto the ends, which a Chriſtian ſhould propound: <hi>when</hi> they are deſtructive and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous unto our Brethren:

                  <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> generally thus argue: The nature of things indifferent (as the <hi>Learned Hooker</hi> determineth) is neither to be commanded nor forbidden, but left free and arbitrary: But now there are divers humane and voluntary actions, that are in the generall neither commanded, nor forbidden (as to eat, drink, goe a journey, walke into the field:) Therefore there are diverſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and voluntary actions, that are in the generall, and for the kind indifferent. This argument the Papiſts diſlike becauſe they think, that there are <hi>matters of Counſell,</hi> which containe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of morall goodneſſe, and perfection: And yet thinke they are uncommanded, and no man will ſay that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. The Argument of the Schoolmen therefore generally runs thus: Actions, that are neither agreeable, nor diſagreeable unto right reaſon are indifferent: But there are divers humane and voluntary actions, that in their generall nature, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration carry, neither conformity, nor repugnancy unto right reaſon: And therefore there are divers humane and voluntary actions, that are indifferent. This argument is thus managed by

                     <hi>Durand:</hi> That act is neither good nor evill, but indifferent,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102374:11"/>Concerning which there is in the reaſon of man no more recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or irrectitude and obliquity in the affirmation, then in the negation in it's dictating either the practice, or in its dictating the forbearance thereof. For the purſuit and eſchewall of the will are in regard of morall goodneſſe, or badneſſe correſpondent unto the dictates of the practicall underſtanding, and therefore where there is an indifferencie in point of truth in the underſtandings dictates concerning the doing, or not doing of a thing, there is an indifferency in regard of morall goodneſſe or badneſſe in the wills imbracing, or eſchewing of that thing. If the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding erre not, whether it preſcribe the performance, or forbearance of an action, then the will ſinneth not, whether it performe or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare it: But there are divers acts concerning which there is in the reaſon of man no more rectitude, or irrectitude and obliquity in the affirmation, then in the negation of them, in its dictating the practiſe, or in its dictating the forbearance of them: This he proveth becauſe the rectitude of reaſon conſiſts in conformity unto ſome naturall law, or ſome divine law, or ſome law derived from theſe: But there are divers humane actions concerning which, there occurreth no ſuch law, either forbidding, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and therefore there is no rectitude or obliquity in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or underſtandings affirming or denying of them. It is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which way the underſtanding takes, whether it dictates the doing or not doing of them: and conſequently it is indifferent, whether the will willeth, or nilleth them. Here by the way I cannot but take notice, how <hi>Durand</hi> unawares croſſeth their doctrine of Evangelicall Counſels: for <hi>Suarez (de leg. lib. cap.</hi> 14.) will tell him, that <hi>Counſell is not properly a Law:</hi> By this doctrine of <hi>Durand</hi> then in matters of Counſell there ſhould be no rectitude of reaſon, becauſe no conformity unto any law: But this by the by.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> upon actions morally good, or bad, we may lawfully paſſe our Cenſures, that they are ſuch; But we ſhould paſſe raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we ſhould cenſure Divers actions of our Bretheren to be determinately virtuous, or determinately vitious, moraly good or bad: <hi>Let not him that eateth not judge him which eateth. Rom.</hi> 14.2. There are therefore ſome actions, which for their kind are neither good, nor bad, but indifferent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Many acts are evill, onely by the prohibition of ſome poſitive law; As unto the Jewes it was unlawfull to <hi>eate Swines fleſh, to weare a garment of divers colours, as of woollen and linnen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Deut.</hi> 22.11. Theſe actions therefore, and many the like, were of themſelves, and in their owne nature, indifferent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unlawfull onely by the ceremoniall law given unto the Jewes, which law being abrogated, it is now a thing indifferent and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chriſtians to eate ſwines fleſh, or not to eate it, to weare a garment of linſey-woolſey, or not.</p>
                  <p>Unto theſe ſcriptures and reaſons I ſhall adde the teſtimony of <hi>Hierome,</hi> frequently quoted for this purpoſe. <hi>Bonum, inquit,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102374:12"/>eſt continentia, malum eſt luxuria. Inter utrumque indifferens ambulare, capitis, naribus purgamenta projicere, ſputis rheumat a jacere. Hoc nec benum, nec malum eſt: ſivè enim feceris, ſivè non feceris, nec juſtitiam habebis, nec injuſtitiam. Ariſtotle, and Sextus Empyricus</hi> give in their verdict for the truth of this aſſertion, whoſe ſayings the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may peruſe at large in <hi>Raynaudus moral. diſciplin. diſtinct.</hi> 4. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Art.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 39. <hi>pag.</hi> 550.</p>
                  <p>There is but one Conſiderable <hi>objection,</hi> which I ſhall briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and anſwere. Whatſoever agreeth unto the ſpecies, the ſort or kind of a thinge, agreeth unto all individuals contained under it, And therefore if there be humane actions, that be indifferent, <hi>ſecundum ſpeciem,</hi> according to their kind, the Individuals of ſuch actions are indifferent too, which will be oppoſed in a <hi>third Concluſion:</hi> That which doth agree unto a thing <hi>per ſe,</hi> the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereof cannot agree unto it, either <hi>per ſe,</hi> or <hi>per Accidens:</hi> And therefore if ſome actions are <hi>per ſe</hi> of themſelves indifferent, it is impoſſible for the Individuals of ſuch actions to be morally good, or evill.

                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this objection <hi>Durand anſwereth,</hi> by diſtinguiſhing of a <hi>twofold ſenſe</hi> of this expreſſion. An act is indifferent <hi>ſecundum ſpeciem,</hi> according to it's kind. <hi>The firſt is,</hi> that indifferency is of <hi>the ſpecifick nature</hi> of ſuch an act. And this ſenſe, which is the ſenſe of the objection, is falſe, for then it would be impoſſible for any individuals of ſuch an act not to be indifferent: But now there is a ſecond ſenſe of the expreſſion, that the <hi>ſpecifick nature of ſuch an action doth not involve, or imply in it's notion morall either goodneſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102374:13"/>or ilneſſe,</hi> But is equally and indifferently abſtracted from both: And this ſenſe is true: It is not of the ſpecificke nature of many actions to be determinately good, or determinately evill; though they may be either by circumſtances. As for the confirmation which is added;
<note n="*" place="margin">Moriſan Ethic. Murc: Phyſic.</note> The anſwer unto it is uſually as followeth; A thing may be ſaid to agree unto another <hi>per ſe, either poſitively, or negatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> when it is predicated <hi>in primo,</hi> or <hi>ſecundo modo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condi per ſe,</hi> when it is either an eſſentiall predicate, or proper paſſion: And thus it agreeth unto man to be a ſenſitive creature, to be indued with the powers of underſtanding, willing, laughing, &amp;c: And in this ſenſe indifferency doth not agree <hi>per ſe,</hi> unto any humane voluntary actions, for then it would agree unto them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and in all places, ſo that it would be utterly impoſſible for the individuals of ſuch actions to be morally either good, or bad.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Negatively,</hi> When a thing of it ſelfe is not ſuch, although by accident it may be ſuch: And thus we may ſay of a man, that <hi>per ſe</hi> he is not white, he is not blacke, he is not tawny, he is not of an olive colour, or the like, becauſe each of theſe colours conſidered <hi>ſeparately,</hi> are <hi>accidentall</hi> unto the nature of man, conſidered in the generall, and in it ſelfe: And yet the individuals of the nature of man may ſome of them be white, ſome blacke, ſome tawny, ſome of an olive colour, or the like: Even ſo we may ſay of divers voluntary rationall actions of man; that <hi>per ſe,</hi> (conſidered, as deveſted from all circumſtances) they are indifferent, morally neither good, nor bad: becauſe morall goodneſſe and badneſſe is accidentall unto the nature of ſuch actions conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet the individuals of ſuch actions are all of them either good, or evil, las ſhall be cleared by the next concluſion, unto which before we proceed, let us make ſome application of this ſecond concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this doctrine of Indifferency there are two <hi>failings;</hi> one in <hi>the defect,</hi> Another in the <hi>exceſſe:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſome, that faile in <hi>the defect,</hi> who know not the full extent of indifferency: and ſo either impoſe, as neceſſary, or condemne, as ſinfull, things that are in their owne nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Thus in the primitive Romiſh Church there were ſome new converts, who abſtained from ſwines fleſh, and other meats prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the ceremoniall law, as unlawfull, The uſe of which yet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102374:13"/>was indifferent and lawfull under the Goſpell: <hi>I know, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>) by <hi>the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane of it ſelfe. Rom.</hi> 14.14. Thus alſo amongſt the Corinthians there were ſome weake Chriſtians, that branded for Communion, and fellowſhip with Idolaters all eating of things offered unto idols, Though bought in the market, or eaten at private meetings; In both which yet <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth in generall there was no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 27. Amongſt us there are divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are doubtleſſe well affected in matters of Religion, and yet are too rigid in cenſuring as ſinnes divers innocent and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe recreations: This is an errour in, and conſequently a blemiſh unto the underſtanding: <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a weakneſſe in the faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. that is an imperfection in point of knowledg, and that <hi>privative,</hi> or blameable: For the faith and conſcience of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things is never indifferent, we are never to judg a thing indifferent, to be either ſinfull or neceſſary. Our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>John</hi> 7.24. Judge righteous judgment may be extended unto things and actions as well as perſons: Therefore as we are not to call good, evill, or evill, good; ſo neither are we to call things indifferent, either evill, or neceſſary. This is injuriouſly to ſtraiten the grand Charter of our Chriſtian liberty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly to make the narrow way to heaven narrower then ever God made it. Beſides, it openeth a gappe unto many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, it filleth the Church of God with needleſſe, and endleſſe diſputes, it perplexeth the minds of many conſcientious people with unneceſſary and unprofitably ſcruples; it cauſeth many bitter and uncharitable cenſures, and occaſioneth many dangers: In the believing Jewes that lived in the Church of Rome, in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, there was but a little miſtake touching things indifferent, meats and daies; but how pernicious was the ſequele hereof? Hereupon the ſtrong deſpiſed the weake, and the weak judged the ſtrong, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. And this was a great diſturbance unto the peace of the Church, and a great hinderance unto the comfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Againſt</hi> this doctrine of indifferency there are ſome, <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that faile in the <hi>exceſſe,</hi> who make things neceſſary or ſinfull, to be but indifferent. There be ſome, that hold obſervation of the Lords day, preaching of the word, in diſtinction from meer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102374:14"/>of it to be no ordinances of God, but things meerly indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; <hi>Eraſtians</hi> affirme, that Church Government, and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſures are onely matters of indifferency: The Heathens in the Apoſtles times generally ranked fornication amongſt things indifferent: The like eſtimate ſome of the Corinthians had of eating things offered to Idols, in the midſt of an Idols temple, at a religious feaſt of that Idol, which was a palpable communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Devils, and therefore a fact in it's own nature unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: And ſome Travailers, that profeſſe themſelves Proteſtants, have as large and looſe Conſciences, as theſe Corinthians had; for they have the ſame opinion of being preſent at an idolatrous maſſe, and bowing to popiſh Idols. Dr <hi>Peter Heylin</hi> (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe informeth us) made no ſcruple of kiſſing a Crucifix, when it was deſired of him, to diſcriminate him from a Hugenot: No leſſe looſe were the Principles of the <hi>Adiaphoriſts,</hi> and <hi>Flaccians</hi> in Charles the 5th his time, who preſſed the <hi>Interim;</hi> which gave allowance to divers errours, and ſuperſtitions of the Church of Rome, as matters that were indifferent: Our Prelatiſts ever and anon in the controverſy of Symbolicall ceremonies alleadge their indifferencie as a thing without diſpute, which is never granted by us; however it may ſometimes for diſputation ſake be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But what talke we of Ceremonies, whil'ſt ſome of greateſt note among'ſt them have ſo eagerly pleaded for ſuch ſports, and paſtimes upon the Lords day as indifferent, which a devout Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt would reckon a groſſe profanation thereof? Now this latter failing againſt the Doctrine of indifferent actions, in a way of exceſſe, is as much againſt the Purity of the Church, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fayling, in a way of defect, was againſt the peace of the Church: It opens as wide a dore to all licentiouſneſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe to call good and evill indifferent, as it doth to call good evill, or evill good, and therefore a woe equally belongs unto it with this latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> we may be exhorted unto thankfulneſſe, Becauſe God hath indulged us Chriſtians a greater extent of our liberty about things indifferent, then he ever vouchſafed unto the Jewiſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. Many things, in their own nature indifferent, were prohibited them by poſitive precepts, and ſo made unlawfull unto them; This was a yoak (ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi>) which they were unable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102374:14"/>to beare, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Bleſſed therefore be God, who hath freed us from this yoake by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath <hi>aboliſhed</hi> in <hi>his fleſh</hi> the law of <hi>Commandments contained in Ordinances, Eph.</hi> 2.15. So that now <hi>all</hi> (indifferent) <hi>things are lawfull</hi> unto us; <hi>There is nothing uncleane of it ſelfe,</hi> Rom. 14.14. <hi>all things indeed are pure,</hi> Rom. 14.20. <hi>

                  <p>There be <hi>two waies,</hi> unto which I ſhall direct for expreſſing our thankfulneſſe for the inlargement of this our liberty. 1. <hi>A ſtout aſſerting of it.</hi> 2. <hi>A due and diſcreet uſe of it.</hi>

The Apoſtle would have us not to be intangled againe with the Jewiſh yoake of bondage; And there is the ſame reaſon, why in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things we ſhould decline any other yoake of bondage, which any man whatſoever ſhould make, and attempt to put upon our necks: for liberty towards things indifferent is one branch of that liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made us free: and therefore we ſhould ſtand faſt againſt all oppoſers.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102374:15"/>caution: <hi>Him, that is weak in the faith, receive you, but not to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſputations, Rom.</hi> 14.1. The Apoſtle doth not prohibite allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all diſputations for the future touching the point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: for he himſelfe elſewhere very zealouſly diſputes the matter, only he interdicts ſuch diſputes as were unſeaſonable for the preſent: becauſe theſe Jewiſh converts were ſo extreamly wedded unto the Law of Moſes, as that to have preſt upon them in their firſt converſion an abolition thereof, was the ready way to have utterly prejudiced them againſt and alienated them from Chriſtianity: He would have them firſt to be taught <hi>the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 5.12. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. And when they were well principled, and ſetled in the Chriſtian faith, then they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a calme, and peaceable debate of this ſubject: for then their mind would be more capable of inſtruction, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned prejudice would be more eaſily removed: Indeed, after a while, there would be no place for ſuch a prejudice: for when once there was a plenary promulgation of the Goſpell, to obſerve them afterwards would be a <hi>virtuall</hi> abrenunciation of the Chriſtian Religion, a denyall, that Chriſt is come in the fleſh. When once the Apoſtles had gived the Jewiſh Synagogue and Ceremonies an honourable funerall, and reſpective buriall, for any man afterwards to revive the obſervation of them, would be to rake in their duſt, and ſacrilegiouſly to violate their grave: <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indè nunc quiſquis Chriſtianorum, quamvis ſit ex Judaeis, ſimilitèr ea celebrare voluerit, tanquam ſopitos cineres eruens, non erit pius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor vel baiulus corporis, ſed impius ſepulturae violator, Auguſt: Epiſt.</hi> 19.</p>

                     <hi>A ſecond way</hi> of expreſſing our thankfulneſſe for the extenſion of our Chriſtian liberty in things indifferent <hi>is a due and diſcreet uſe of it,</hi> ſuch an uſe of it as may ſt, and with Gods glory, and may be no waies inconſiſtent with our own or others edification.

                  <p>To informe us more fully, and particularly what we are to doe in this weighty point, I ſhall briefly propound ſuch reſtraints, as we are by the rule of Scripture to put on the uſe, and exerciſe of our Chriſtian liberty in things indifferent, for without ſuch reſtraints we can never uſe this our liberty aright, and as we ought: There be ſome looſe people, that are impatient of all theſe reſtraints: If they judg a thing lawfull in it ſelfe, they never conſider, or conſult farther, but without more adoe adventure on it: But theſe men ever and anon abuſe their libertie unto Gods diſhonour, their own danger, and the ſcandall of both bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and aliens: <hi>They uſe their liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh, for a cloake of maliciouſneſſe:</hi> He that gives himſelfe the full ſwing in things indifferent, He that will doe whatſoever is lawfull, will ſoone ſlide into things unlawfull, and ere he is aware indulge himſelfe in the practice of them: So <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>

                     </gap>. 1. <hi>Qui faciunt quicquid licet, huc cito delabuntur, ut faciant quod non licet.</hi> For prevention of this licentiouſneſſe, I ſhall out of Gods word recommend unto you <hi>ſix reſtraints</hi> to be put upon this part of your Chriſtian liberty in the uſe and exerciſe of it, 1. <hi>By Prudence.</hi> 2. <hi>By Temperance and Sobriety.</hi> 3. <hi>By Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> 4. <hi>By Religion.</hi> 5. <hi>By Authority.</hi> 6. <hi>By Charity,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By Prudence:</hi> which in indifferent things is, <hi>firſt,</hi> to compare them with thoſe ends which every Chriſtian ſhould ayme at. 2. To conſider whether there concurre not an obligation to ſome duty, or other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt then, It is the worke of Chriſtian prudence to compare indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent actions with thoſe ends, which every Chriſtian ſhould propound
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102374:16"/>unto himſelfe:</hi> the glorifying of God, the ſalvation of his own ſoule, and the edifying of Brethren: And to examine whether they be expedient, or inexpedient, profitable and conducing, or unprofitable and impedient unto theſe ends: And if upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration it finds them inexpedient, an hinderance unto theſe ends, it then forthwith dictates a forbearance of them: Becauſe whatſoever is an impediment unto theſe ends is oppoſite unto them, and in that regard ſinfull: This reſtraint our Apoſtle lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe in way of Doctrine for the inſtruction of all. <hi>All things are lawfull for me, But all things are not expedient,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. and <hi>Chapt</hi> 9. we have him putting it upon himſelfe in his own practiſe: It was lawfull for him to have received of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians a competent, and honourable maintenance, for his labour in the Word and Doctrine, as being a matter of due debt from them: But he did not exact it, but wrought with his hands for his livelyhood, becauſe he found it would have obſtructed, and hindered the end of his preaching, which was the ſpreading of the Goſpell, that the word of the Lord might have free courſe, and be glorified in the converſion of ſoules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond act of Prudence about indifferent things is to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that nicke of time we are about an indifferent action there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre not an obligation unto ſome duty or other;</hi> And if there doe, then prudence dictates, that <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> we ſhould abſtaine from that indifferent action; becauſe otherwiſe we ſhould preferre it above a neceſſary and commanded duty; And though it be ſimply in it ſelfe lawfull, it would become accidentally ſinfull, to wit, by compariſon; Thus it would be ſinfull for a man to walke in the fields, if there lay upon him at the ſame time an obligation to heare <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſermon: Thus alſo it would be ſinfull for a man to follow recreations in themſelves lawfull, when the neceſſities of his family call upon him to follow his occupation, the workes of his ordinary calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond Reſtraint</hi> (that we are to put upon the uſe of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about things indifferent) <hi>is by temperance and ſobriety,</hi> and this reſtraint alſo we have laid downe by the Apoſtle in the place but now quoted. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>All things are lawfull for me, But I will not be brought under the power of any:</hi> Now what is it that brings a man under the power of meates, and drinkes, apparell, recreations?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102374:16"/>but an over-vehement affection unto them. This makes man a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall unto thoſe things, over which God hath given him a full Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and dominion: <hi>Qui nimis rem aliquam amat (ſaith Aquinas) quodam modo ſervus iſtius efficitur,</hi> He that loves a thing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, renders himſelfe thereby the ſervant thereof: <hi>Know yee not that to whome yee yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants yee are, to whom yee obey, Rom.</hi> 6.16. He that immoderately affects thoſe things, that are in themſelves indifferent, cannot diſobey, or reſiſt the leaſt temptation unto ſinne drawn from them, and therefore is no better then a ſlave unto them, nay an Idolater of them: You may ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> cenſures the falſe Prophets for ſuch an exceſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>They that are ſuch ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their owne belly, Their God is their belly Phil.</hi> 3.19. We may ſay the like of thoſe, that like the rich glutton, <hi>Luke.</hi> 16.19. <hi>fare ſumptuouſly or deliciouſly every day,</hi> and will have a ſplendid retinue, when the lowneſſe of their ſtate requires a meaner table and ſmaller attendance; of thoſe that are wedded unto ſuch gaiety and bravery of apparell as is above their purſes, or unſuitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their age, and ranke; As alſo of thoſe that are ſo mad upon their recreations, ſports and paſtimes, as that in the purſuite of them they forgoe their meales, and ſleepe, they neglect the worſhip of God, and their particular callings, unto their great impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if not finall and totall beggery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A third limitation</hi> upon the exerciſe of our Chriſtian liberty in things indifferent <hi>is to be by conſcience:</hi> for though a mans conſcience cannot legitimate ſinnes, either of Commiſſion, or Omiſſion; yet it is of force ſufficient to make that ſinfull, which is in it felfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, &amp; lawfull: for this we have the Apoſtles determination, and that touching both <hi>a condemning and doubting conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Condemning Conſcience,</hi> Rom. 14.14. <hi>I know and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Lord Ieſus, that their is nothing uncleane of it ſelfe; But unto him that eſteemethany thing to be uncleane, to him it is unclean.</hi> Unto the authority of <hi>Pauls</hi> Teſtimony I ſhall adde <hi>two reaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Every man takes the voyce of his conſcience to be the voyce of God; And therefore he that doth a thing in it ſelfe indifferent againſt the judgement of his Conſcience, he diſobeyeth and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the voyce of God, <hi>as for the manner of</hi> his action, and is a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt God.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102374:17"/>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon I ſhall give you in the words of <hi>Willet</hi> upon the place, <hi>Becauſe the goodneſſe or badneſſe of an action is eſteemed by the will and affection of the doer; Now when he thinketh a thing to be evill, and yet doth it, It ſhewes that ſuch an one hath, deliberatam peccandi voluntatem, a deliberate mind and purpoſe to ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> gives us the ſame reſolution touching a <hi>Doubting conſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth, is damned if he eate, becauſe he eateth not of faith; for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſinne:</hi> that is; he that performech an indifferent action, and yet doubteth of the lawfulneſſe thereof, deſerveth damnation, becauſe he doth not act out of faith; for whatſoever we performe, though, it be <hi>(intrinſecally, in it ſelfe)</hi> matter of indifferency; nay though it be matter of duty, yet if it proceed not from a beliefe of it's lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it becomes <hi>(accidentally and extrinſecally)</hi> ſinfull; It bewrayes a wicked and a wretched heart, that is not afraid of ſinne, but in a great readineſſe to commit it; who, almoſt would doe any thing that he doubteth would anger and grieve a deare friend? God then is not ſo deare as he ſhould be unto ſuch men, as dare adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the practiſe of that, which they are doubtfull is diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him: Let us therefore hearken unto that exhortation, which the Apoſtle gave unto the Romans concerning thinges indifferent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his owne minde:</hi> And this exhortation he backes with a very good reaſon. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Happy is he which condemneth not himſelfe in that thing which he alloweth:</hi> that is, he that doth not condemne as ſinnefull, that which he chooſeth and embraceth in his practiſe; ſuch a man is in <hi>that reſpect, and ſo farre forth</hi> happy, as being free from thoſe terrors, which torment thoſe, who do what their conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, that not only condemnation, but doubtfulneſſe of Conſcience is a ſufficient warrant to forbeare things that are in themſelves indifferent: <hi>But yet it is no ground for us to aſſume a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of condemning the ſame things in others, who are ſufficiently ſatiſfied touching their indifferency and lawfulneſſe: Let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth. Rom.</hi> 14.3. Let not him that is weake in the faith, that out of ignorance cenſureth, or ſuſpecteth divers actions to be ſinnefull, which he cannot prove to be ſo by any convincing argument; Let not ſuch an one condemne for ſuch actions the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102374:17"/>ſtrong in the faith, thoſe who are as godly and more knowing, then themſelves: This exhortation the Apoſtle enforceth by divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the following words; <hi>for God hath received him; who art thou, that judgeſt another mans ſervant? To his owne maſter he ſtandeth or falleth, yea, he ſhall be holden up; for God is able to make him ſtand, ver.</hi> 3.4.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> argument is taken from <hi>the relation of the ſtrong unto God, or Gods acceptation of them; for God hath received him;</hi> to wit, into his favour, into an intimate union, and communion, into his family, as a ſervant, as a ſonne, as a member of his onely begotten ſonne: To condemne him then is to throw a diſhonour upon God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon is, Becauſe for the weake to condemne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions of the ſtrong for ſinne, of which they cannot prove them guilty, <hi>is a groſſe and preſumptuous vſurpation of Gods preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for which we have no Authority: who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant?</hi> Thou art but a fellow ſervant at the moſt: And God only is the maſter of the family, the Church: and therefore the unlawfulneſſe of what is done in it is to be determined by Gods precepts, and not by thy humour, or fancy, thy ungrounded ſurmiſes: If God hath permitted a thing, how dareſt thou interdict it? <hi>To his own maſter h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtandeth, or falleth.</hi> The words are to be underſtood in a law-ſenſe, and their meaning is that God alone acquits or condemnes the actions of his ſervants, and none elſe: They are to be tryed by his word and will, and not by thy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſuſpicions. Others expound the words thus: If a man eat and drink temperately with outward prayer and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who but God can diſcerne, whether he eat or drink unto the glory of God, or no? It followeth <hi>he ſhall be holden up:</hi> that is, he ſhall be juſtified. This fact of his, his eating of meats forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Leviticall Law, ſhall be abetted and maintained: <hi>For God is able to make him ſtand:</hi> though thou load him with cenſures, God is able to acquit, and cleare him.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſubmiſſion unto every Ordinance of man, and our Chriſtian freedome may very well ſtand together: We may ſubmit our ſelves as free: we may be obedient ſubiects, and yet free Chriſtians: This may alſo be further gathered from what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102374:19"/>the Apoſtle hath in the following words touching the abuſe, and uſe of our Chriſtian liberty; <hi>Not uſing your liberty as a cloake for maliciouſneſſe, but as ſervants of God:</hi> Here we have. 1. A <hi>dehortation</hi> from the abuſe of our Chriſtian liberty, <hi>not uſing your liberty as a cloake of maliciouſneſſe:</hi> now to alleadge it as a plea for exemption of us from the yoake of temporall dominion, is to uſe it as a cloake of maliciouſneſſe; for not onely ſcripture, but even nature it ſelfe condemneth diſobedience unto, and rebellion againſt magiſtrates, as a very High point of maliciouſneſſe, that is naughtineſſe, and wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We</hi> have here a <hi>Direction</hi> unto a right uſe of our liberty, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it <hi>as the ſervants of God:</hi> Now the ſervice of God is ſo farre from being a barre, as that it is rather a ſpurre unto this ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for <hi>Firſt;</hi> it is for the Lords ſake, that <hi>Peter</hi> would have us to <hi>ſubmit our ſelves unto every ordinance of man,</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> How can be cordially ſerve God, that contemnes and diſobeyes his deputy, and miniſters? ſo the Apoſtle ſtiles the magiſtrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4, 6.

                  </p>
                  <p>But now, (that we may not runne into another extreame, and with the flatterers of ſtates, and Princes, extoll the power of the magiſtrate beyond all bounds of moderation;) I ſhall deſire you to take notice, that the power of the magiſtrate in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is not <hi>arbitrary,</hi> but is to be limited by <hi>the end of all Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the publick good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God unto thee for good.</hi> Unto this publick good ſome indifferent things carry a tendency, and ſuch the magiſtrate may command; unto it others may be prejudiciall, and ſuch he may forbid: But now he ſhould abuſe his power, and play the tyrant, If he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne things unprofitable; As if he ſhould command men to throw ſtones into the water, to pick ſtrawes, to ſcatter feathers into the aire, or the like.

And <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſuppoſeth that he ſpeaks literally of a true eye and hand indeed: neither (ſaith he) is there any abſurdity in ſuch a ſenſe: becauſe the plucking out of the right eye, and the cutting off the right hand is mentioned only in a way of <hi>hyperbolicall exaggeration.</hi> In which there is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſuch an exception, as is uſuall in the like caſes, <hi>if it might be, if it were lawfull:</hi> He parallels it with a hyperbole of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. <hi>I beare you record, that if it had been poſſible, yee would have pluckt out your own eyes, and have given them unto me; If it had been poſſible:</hi> that is, as <hi>Eſtius gloſſeth</hi> it, <hi>ſi natura permitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> If nature would give way unto ſuch a mutilation: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

And therefore indifferent things are to be forborne in caſe of ſcandall, when they prove to be of a deſtructive nature unto the ſoules of men, when they weaken their graces, hinder their duties, and lead them into ſin. This courſe the Apoſtle preſcribes unto the Romanes in the caſe of things legally uncleane before the coming of Chriſt. Thoſe that were ſtrong in the faith among them, well inſtructed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtian liberty, knew very well, that the legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102374:20"/>of meates and drinkes, all Jewiſh feſtivalls and faſts were removed by Chriſts death, and that nothing was now of it ſelfe uncleane, but all things indifferent and lawfull: yet the Apoſtle would have them in the uſe of this point of Chriſtian liberty not to ſcandalize thoſe, that are weak in the faith, that is, ſuch as (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly wonne from Judaiſme to Chriſtianity) were as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtructed about the ceſſation of Ceremonialls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling block, or occaſion, to fall in his brothers way;</hi> that is in the uſe of meats and drinkes, that were before the Goſpell Levitically uncleane, and neglect of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Feſtivalls and faſts, the obſervation of which was for a while indifferent, untill the interrement of the Ceremoniall law: For however the words run generally, yet if we look to the coherence backwards, the foregoing part of the chapter ſpeaks onely of ſuch things, meates, drinkes, and daies: and if we look to the coherence forwards, it ſpeaks onely of ſuch things, meats and drinks, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meate, for whom Chriſt died,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>for the kingdome of God is not meat and drinke.</hi> v. 20. <hi>for meate deſtroyes not the worke of God: it is evill for that man who eateth with offence: It is evill</hi> not <hi>ſimply</hi> in it ſelfe, but <hi>accidentally</hi> by ſcandall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall conclude, that the place is in a ſpeciall manner appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt ſcandalizing by abuſe of liberty in things indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Interpreters gheſſe at <hi>three</hi> things, wherein the practiſe of the ſtrong amongſt the Romanes might ſcandalize the weake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It might unſettle them in, and diſtaſt them againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion:</hi> for they might hereupon think it to be contrary unto the Law of Moſes, which they ſo highly reverenced, and ſo at laſt it might occaſion their relapſe unto Judaiſme. 2. <hi>It might embolden them to ſinne againſt their conſciences,</hi> by eating that which they thought to be uncleane.

                  <p>In <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. The Apoſtle proceedeth to inlarge his doctrine touching this particular, beyond the controverſy, that occaſioned this his diſcourſe: for (as <hi>Eſtius</hi> well noteth) He teacheth, that to avoid the ſcandall and offence of our Brethren we are to abſtaine, not onely from things prohibited by the law, but alſo from things
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102374:21"/>not prohibited, from fleſh, wine, and any indifferent thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: <hi>It is good neither to eat fleſh, nor to drinke wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weake. It is good,</hi> that is, it is <hi>morally</hi> good. 1. Good <hi>in regard of God,</hi> a thing very acceptable, and pleaſing unto him. 2. Good <hi>in regard of our Brethren,</hi> profitable and conducing unto their edification. 3.

                  <p>In <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. The Apoſtle prevents an objection of the ſtrong: <hi>Haſt thou faith, have it to thy ſelfe before God:</hi> He ſpeaks not of a faith (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) that is <gap reason="foreign">

Liberty is a thing, which men out of an exceſſive ſelfe love ſo much overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as that they are very impatient of any reſtraint to be put upon it at all: But the Reſtraint, that Charity prompts us unto, is of all others moſt diſregarded; becauſe there is nothing almoſt, that is ſo much undervalued, as the precious ſoules of our poore Brethren, and therefore we make but little conſcience how thick we throw ſcandals in their way: I ſhall therefore briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſuch weighty, and preſſing arguments, as the Apoſtle uſeth to perſwade the Romans, and Corinthians to abſtaine from a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102374:22"/>uſe of their liberty in things otherwiſe indifferent, and lawfull: and they are drawn, either, <hi>from the nature of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or from the nature of ſcandall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the nature of things indifferent:</hi> and here, the <hi>firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is Rom. 14.17. <hi>the kingdome of God is not meate and drinke:</hi> It doth not ſtand in indifferent things; for they are neither the way to the kingdome of Glory, nor our duty under the kingdome of grace: They are no part of Gods worſhip, and ſervice, no matter of Religion: the weale and ſafety of Gods people is in no wiſe wrapt up in them; nay, many times a rigid preſſing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable practice of them is a great diſturbance unto the peace, and a great hinderance unto the edification of the Church, the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond Argument</hi> from the nature of things indifferent, is <hi>the great latitude of them:</hi> Though ſome of them be ſcandalous yet there will ſtill remaine an ample field of them beſides, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.28. <hi>If any man ſay unto you, this is offered in ſacrifice unto idols, eat not for his ſake, that ſhewed it, &amp;c. the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof:</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid; though ye abſtaine from things offered unto idols, yet there is no doubt of want, no feare of pinching your bellies: for you have the earth, and the fulneſſe thereof for your ſupply: And from the ſcandall by meats, we may argue in like manner touching the ſcandall by recreation: If cards, dyce, tables offend thy brother, there is plenty enough of other ſports, bowling, cheſſe, draughts, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond ſort</hi> of arguments, that the Apoſtle inſiſts on, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>from the nature of ſcandall:</hi> It is a ſinne againſt that tender love, which we owe unto our brethren: <hi>And when ye ſinne ſo againſt the brethren,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.12.

Unjuſtly to wound the body, the face, the eye of our Brother is a cruell and inhumane part; but to wound ſo tender a piece as his conſcience, to wound a weake, a ſicklie, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed conſcience is the very height of inhumanity. To wound
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102374:22"/>the ſoule of a Brother <hi>with ſorrow,</hi> is a breach of charity; <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably,</hi> Rom. 14.15. And hence we may reaſon in a way of compariſon <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> that to wound the ſoule of a Brother <hi>with ſinne,</hi> violates Chriſtian love in a farre higher meaſure; for the wound of the leaſt ſinne is in its own nature mortall; and therefore ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall is not onely of a wounding, but of a killing and deſtroying nature; it is a ſoule murder, <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meat,</hi> Rom. 14.15. Indeed the weak, that were ſcandalized, might by Gods mercy, and Chriſt's merit, eſcape an actuall deſtroying and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: But the Apoſtles meaning is, that the ſtrongs ſcandalizing of them carried in it's nature a tendency towards their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it drew them into ſinne, and ſinne without repentance will deſtroy the ſoule: This malignant and deſtructive efficacy of ſcandall the Apoſtle urgeth alſo unto the <hi>Corinthians Epiſtle</hi> 1. <hi>chapt.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>And through thy knowledg ſhall thy weake brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:</hi> that is; through thy ſcandalous abuſe of thy knowledg of thy liberty in eating things offered unto idols, thou ſhalt doe, what lieth in thee, to farther the periſhing of thy weake Brother: This cruelty that is in ſcandall towards the ſoules of our Brethren, is aggravated from <hi>Chriſts Redemption, Gods Creation</hi> of their ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From Chriſts Redemption of their ſoules: Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died, Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>And through thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſhall the weake brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died? But when ye ſin ſo againſt the Brethren, and wound their weak conſcience, ye ſinne againſt Chriſt:</hi> 1 Cor. 8.11, 12. In the judgment of charity thou art to rank thy weake Brother in the number of thoſe, for whom Chriſt dyed: Chriſt died for his ſalvation, and how da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou oppoſe his worke by doing that, which tends unto his damnation? Chriſt parted with his life to ſave him, and wilt not thou for that end abridg thy ſelfe of thy liberty in a few indifferent things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From Gods creation of their ſoules: for meat deſtroy not the worke of God, Rom.</hi> 14.20. that is the ſoule of thy brother: for that is ſtiled Gods worke in a way of <hi>eminency:</hi> becauſe it was one of the choyceſt, chiefeſt, and moſt eminent workes of the Creation, made as it were with the conſultation of the whole Trinity, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102374:23"/>had in it engraven the very Image of God himſelfe: Therefore not only the defacing, but the very attempting to deface this would redound very much unto the diſhonour of the worker God; And he will doubtleſſe accordingly reſent the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his workmanſhip: Some interpreters expound the place of the work of Gods grace in the ſanctification, or regeneration of the ſoule, wherein faith is begotten, and that faith in a peculiar manner is the worke of God, we have Chriſts own teſtimony, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto them, this is the worke of God, that ye believe on him, whom he hath ſent:</hi> But even ſo the words diſplay the horrid malignancy of ſcandall: for they ſhew that he who ſcandalizeth his brother, fighteth againſt God; that he goeth about to demoliſh that, which hath God alone for the builder. It was a part of Chriſts character not to <hi>breake a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax, Mat.</hi> 12.20. How unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto this, is the diſpoſition of thoſe by whom offences come? For they doe what lieth in them to quench the very beginnings of grace, and goodneſſe. Indeed the worke of Gods grace is ſo all-powerfull, as that it will finally prevaile againſt all reſiſtance: If God have <hi>begunne a good worke, he will performe it untill the day of Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>And the gates of hell ſhall never be able to prevaile againſt it,</hi> Matth. 16.18. But yet the gates of hell will be ever hindering of it: and in eſpeciall by the ſpreadth of ſcandals. And this very oppoſition is a warre againſt heaven, (in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scripture) a deſtroying of the worke of God. There is one ſequele more of active ſcandals of this nature, that our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle mentioneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. which deſerveth alſo our conſideration: and it is the blot of infamy, which they will contract unto our names, and the very Chriſtian liberty, which we abuſe: A ſcandall in this caſe, <hi>tending unto ſinne,</hi> is uſually accompanied with a <hi>ſcandall tending unto diſgrace,</hi> or defamation: And how carefull we ſhould be to decline ſcandall, even in this Engliſh ſenſe of the word, the vehemency of the Apoſtles interrogations will ſufficiently informe us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>Conſcience, I ſay, not thine own, but of the others: for why is my liberty judged of another mans conſcience? for, if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, for that for which I give thanks?</hi> Unto theſe interrogations adde we the Apoſtles precept alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Let not then your

                  <p>Before I take my leave of this reſtraint of our liberty by Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the caſe of ſcandall, I ſhall examine the reſtraints, that ſome have put upon it, without any warrant from ſcripture: Thoſe in which they moſt confide, are two. 1. <hi>They limit it unto the ſcandall of the weake, and,</hi> 2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto matters that are undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They</hi> limit it unto the <hi>ſcandall of the weake:</hi> for the ſcandall of the malicious, and preſumptuous perſons, The ſcandall of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes</hi> (ſay they) may be neglected, Mat. 15.12, 14. whether in our Ceremonies there was an active ſcandall, a ſcandall given will be largely diſputed in the next treatiſe, for the preſent therefore we ſhall only prove that we are to avoid ſuch an active ſcandall in the malicious, as well as the weake.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such a ſcandall is of a ſoule deſtroying nature: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not him with thy meate, Rom.</hi> 14.15. And who ſo wicked, and malicious upon the face of the earth, whoſe ſoule a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity will exclude from it's care, mercy, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apoſtles motive reacheth unto the wicked and malicious: <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meat, for whom Chriſt died, Rom.</hi> 14.15. for they may be in the number of thoſe, for whom Chriſt died, who for their preſent ſtate and condition may be moſt wicked, and malicious; ſuch as oppoſe themſelves, ſuch as are in the ſnare of the Devill, taken captive by him at his will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apoſtles prohibition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. extendeth unto the malicious, as well as the weake, <hi>Give none offence neither to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God:</hi> where Jewes and Gentiles are diſtinguiſhed from the Church of God; and therefore by them are meant ſuch as were unconverted, and as yet enemies unto the faith of Chriſt, and Church of God. And the things wherein the Apoſtle would have their offence to be avoided were matters of indifferency; <hi>Whether ye eat or drinke, v.</hi> 31. But now, leſt ſome ſhould be ready to object unto <hi>Paul</hi> that which our Saviour ſaid of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.4. <hi>that he did bind a heavy burden and grievous to be borne, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102374:24"/>lay it upon mens ſhoulders: but he himſelfe would not move it with one of his fingers:</hi> the Apoſtle in the next verſe ſheweth, how that his practice was conformable unto his precept, <hi>Even as I pleaſe all men</hi> (good and bad) <hi>in all things</hi> (that is, in all indifferent things) <hi>not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>ſecond place,</hi> the Fautors of our Ceremonies limit this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of our liberty in things indifferent by charity, in the caſe of ſcandall, onely <hi>unto things undetermined by Authority.</hi> Where Authority hath determined our choice, we muſt (ſay they) hold to their determination, any ſcandall to the Contrary notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It ſeems then in caſe the magiſtrate command it, <hi>we may wound the weake conſciences of our Brother, Deſtroy with our indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies, the worke of God, him for whom Chriſt died.

But our <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> determine quite otherwiſe, if authority enjoyne it, it is good (ſay they) to eat bread, drink wine, weare a ſurplice, uſe the ſigne of the croſſe in Baptiſme, though thereby never ſo many Brethren ſtumble, or are offended, or made weake.</p>
                  <p>The unreaſonableneſſe of this aſſertion <hi>Ames</hi> in his reply to <hi>Morton</hi> hath proved by many arguments, That are as yet unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, which I ſhall here tranſcribe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſcandall in the nature of it is ſpirituall murder: Now ſuppoſe a ſuperiour ſhould command a thing in it ſelfe indifferent, whereupon murder were like to follow; as to runne a horſe, or a cart, in a certaine way, at a certaine time, when it may be unwitting to the commander, little children were playing in the way, would any mans conſcience ſerve him to doe it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avoiding of ſcandall is a maine duty of Charity: May Superiours at their pleaſure appoint how farre I ſhall ſhew my Charity towards my brothers ſoule? Then ſurely an inferiour earthly court may croſſe the determinations of the high court of heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſuperiours have no power given them for deſtruction, but onely for edification: If therefore they command ſcandals, they goe beyond their Commiſſion: neither are we tied therein to doe as they bid, but as they ſhould bid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:102374:24"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If determination by ſuperiours were ſufficient to take away the ſinne of a ſcandall. Then they doe very ill that they do not (ſo farre as is poſſible) determine all things indifferent, that ſo no danger may be left in giving of offence by the uſe of them. Then the Church of Rome is to be praiſed, in that ſhe hath determined of ſo many indifferents: then</hi> Paul <hi>with the other Apoſtles might have ſpared a great deale of labour in admoniſhing the Churches how they ſhould avoid offences about ſome indifferent things: A farre ſhorter way had been either to determine the matter fully: or elſe to have given order, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould among themſelves determine it at home.</hi>

                  <p>If the Prelates would have ſeriouſly laid to heart that golden ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Cor. 8.13. <hi>If meate make my brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh, while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to offend</hi>) This would ſuperſede all further diſpute of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for thence it is eaſie to evict, that it is unlawfull for Church governours to command the obſervation of things indifferent, when in all probability they will ſcandalize: how dare they make that the matter of a Church Canon, which <hi>Paul</hi> durſt not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon in his own perſonall practice? He thought it unlawfull to do a thing otherwiſe indifferent, to eat fleſh in the caſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall; and therefore doubtleſſe he judged it unlawfull in ſuch a caſe to impoſe any ſuch matter upon others: Greater was the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102374:25"/>of the fleſh forborne by <hi>Paul</hi> unto his health, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his life; then the profit of the controverted ceremonies can be unto the worſhip and ſervice of God: And beſides, the indifferency of eating fleſh was a thing cleare, and evident unto all, that were well inſtructed in the Doctrine of Chriſtian liberty; whereas the indifferency of our ceremonies will at leaſt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very doubtfull matter, and that by very indifferent men, who ſhall thoroughly ponder the Arguments of <hi>Didoclave, Parker, Ames</hi> and others againſt them, which to this day remaine unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. The Prelates will not pretend unto ſuch an ample au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> had: But though they be farre inferiour unto him in point of Authority, they are not yet ſo humble, as to imitate him in the condeſcention of his charity. <hi>Pauls</hi> peremptorie reſolve was to forbeare a thing indifferent, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But what a wide difference, nay contrariety was there betwixt this charitable reſolution of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the rigid practiſe of the Prelates. For they were obſtinately bent to preſſe the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, with all ſeverity, without any care, or Conſcience of the ſcandals enſuing: nay their endeavour was daily to adde unto the heape of former ceremonies, though they knew that thereby the ſcandals would be increaſed: They ſpake a language quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of <hi>Paul:</hi> we will enjoyne (ſay they) the ſurplice, croſſe, kneeling in the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, while the world ſtandeth, as long as we have any power, and authority in the Church of God, Let who will be offended: This their rigour brings unto my mind a cruel command of

The boy eſcaping from thoſe appointed for his execution, proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the feet of Caeſar, who then ſup't with his maſter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not pardon, but onely commutation of ſo horrid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall a death: <hi>Auguſtus was extreamly</hi> tranſported with the ſtrangeneſſe and novelty of ſo inhumane a cruelty, and hereupon to prevent the like for the future he forthwith commanded all the Chriſtall glaſſes of <hi>Pollio,</hi> though his friend, to be broken, and the fiſhpond to be filled up: for the breaking of a ſorry glaſſe he thought it a diſproportioned and too ſevere a puniſhment, to have a mans bowels pluck't in pieces, and torne aſunder. This ſpirit of <hi>Vedius Pollio</hi> breathed in many of our late Prelates; The Ceremonies in compariſon of mens ſoules were but as paltry trifles, as glaſſes, and feathers: and yet, by the maintenance of them, they hazarded the ſoules of thouſands (In as much as in them lay) <hi>they deſtroyed the worke of God, they deſtroyed thoſe for whom Chriſt died;</hi> they ſcandalize Papiſts, and ſeparatiſts: people and Paſtours: conformiſts, and non-conformiſts, as Mr <hi>Parker</hi> at large demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: Dr <hi>John Burgeſſe</hi> (as I have often heard) urged this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Sermon before King <hi>James</hi> to perſwade him unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition of the Ceremonies: And King <hi>James</hi> had doubtleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a Chriſtian, and royall care of his people, if he had broken theſe glaſſes in pieces: if he had caſhered theſe toyes out of the Church, which had broken ſo many in their eſtates, wounded ſo many in their conſciences, and endangered the ſalvation of ſo many ſoules: and hereby have prevented thoſe unſpeakable griefes, feares, and ſcandalls, which they formerly occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>I proceed unto the third and laſt concluſion, which is, that <hi>no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate actions</hi> of men, which proceeds from <hi>deliberate reaſon,</hi> if they be conſidered in <hi>actu exercito,</hi> in the ſingular or particular, <hi>as cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with circumſt ances, are indifferent,</hi> but all of them are morally either good, or evill.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Then; this concluſion is to be underſtood only of an <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate conſideration of the circumſtances</hi> of ſingular actions, for not onely one, but more circumſtances of a humane action in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall may be indifferent: In a conference of ſchollers it is many times indifferent, whether they diſcourſe in latine, or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, whether in the morning, or afternoone: But yet their whole conference conſidered <hi>adequately</hi> with all circumſtances is either good, or evill; And the reaſon is becauſe the determination of an action doth not depend upon one circumſtance apart, but upon all joyntly.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond limitation</hi> of the concluſion is that it is not <hi>to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto every comparative conſideration of humane actions and their circumſtances:</hi> I know, that not onely actions indifferent, but alſo thoſe that are commanded become ſometime to be ſinfull by <hi>compariſon;</hi> when they are preferred to better actions. God diſlikes thoſe recreations, that otherwiſe he alloweth, when they juſtle out duties: nay he abhorreth ſacrifice when it is inconſiſtent with mercy: but notwithſtanding this, when there is an equality, if not of actions themſelves, yet of their morall motives as to <hi>hic,</hi> and <hi>nunc</hi> this preſent time and place, Then curiouſly to compare and ballance ſuch actions, were needleſſe: for in ſuch a caſe, the prelation of one before the other, would be a thing meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, neither good nor bad: Reading, prayer, meditation are things commanded: but many times that I ſet apart ſuch an houre for reading principally may be a thing indifferent: that I make choice of one Recreation before another, of bowling before Cheſſe, draughts, &amp;c. that I chooſe to walke in the forenoon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102374:26"/>then in the afternoon, may be of no morall conſideration, and ſo neither good, nor evill, but a matter of indifferency. Looke as an Image carver may have no peculiar reaſon to make this Image, rather then that; yet if he make any Image at all; either he followeth the rules of his art, and then he makes a good Image, or he ſwarves from thoſe rules, and then he makes a bad image, and doth not worke like an Artiſt: So many times it may be to a Chriſtian, a marter meerly indifferent to performe this or that action, he may have no obligation to doe either, or at leaſt to doe one rather then the other, but may be left unto his own mind, and pleaſure: but yet he is as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an obliged to regard ſuch circumſtances in all his actions, and therefore whatſoever he doth, he doth it either well, or ill; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he obſerveth theſe circumſtances, and then his action is good, or he neglects them, and then it is bad.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion being thus explained may be made apparent <hi>from the end, and rule of deliberate actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From their end,</hi> and what ought to be the end of all deliberate actions of man may be evidenced from their <hi>relation unto their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,</hi> from <hi>a conſideration of them abſolutely as they are in themſelves.</hi>

                  <p>For the further enforcement of this reaſon, I ſhall alleadge, and open ſome few ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is Matth. 12.36. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by an idle word:</hi> that which hath no obliquity in it but this, that it wants a good and honeſt end: That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and unfruitfull, both unto ſpeaker, and hearer: <hi>quod aut utilitate rectitudinis aut ratione juſtae neceſſitatis caret, as Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Homily.</hi> 6. As for thoſe, who think, that an idle word is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto every word, groſſely wicked, falſe, lying, blaſphemous, the very context will diſprove them: The occaſion of our Saviours diſcourſe was that blaſphemy of the Phariſees, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>But when the Phariſees heard it, they ſaid, this fellow doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the Devils:</hi> Now our Saviours drift is to diſcover the ſinfulneſſe; and danger of this blaſphemous ſpeech of theirs: And this he doth, as by ſeverall arguments, ſo particularly, in this verſe, by arguing <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi> from the leſſe to the greater: As if he ſhould have ſaid: <hi>If in the day of judgment ye ſhall give an account for every idle word,</hi> then much more for ſuch a blaſphemous vomit as this of yours, <hi>That I caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by the aſſiſtance of Beelzebub:</hi> That our Saviours Argument here ſtands thus <hi>Maldonate</hi> tels us, all are of that opinion that he ever read.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Saviour proceeds in <hi>a way of aggravating</hi> the now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Blaſphemy: But if by every idle word you underſtand every groſſely wicked, and blaſphemous word, there will be little aggravation hereof: for to ſay that every wicked lying, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous word, that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the day of judgment, falls very ſhort of what was ſpoken allready of this blaſphemy <hi>verſ.</hi> 31.32.

In his correction of their corrupt gloſſes upon the law of God. So then our Saviour ſpeakes of that, which ſounded as very harſh and rigid doctrine in the eares of the Phariſees: <hi>But I ſay unto you that every idle word, that men ſhall ſpeak they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment:</hi> Notwithſtanding your ſlighting thoughts of your vaine, and unprofitable diſcourſe, I, who am the truth, and know fully the mind of God, as being alwaies in his boſome, doe aſſure you, that every idle word, which men ſhall ſpeak, every word, which is not referred unto a good end, they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment.</p>

                     <hi>Suarez</hi> proveth from the ſcope of the words which was to terrifie the Phariſees for their blaſphemy, and to deterre others from the like, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102374:28"/>and amplifying the ſeverity of Gods judgment againſt it: And unto this the threatning of puniſhment and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for every idle word is more conducing, then a propoſall of a bare tryall and examination of every idle word, which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the beſt words and works of men: <hi>becauſe for them they may give an account with joy, Heb.</hi> 13.17. In the words then, there is plainly <hi>a Metalepſis,</hi> the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> to give an account in the day of Judgment is put for the <hi>conſequent</hi> to be puniſhed in hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, <hi>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment:</hi> that is they without repentance ſhall be condemned, and everlaſtingly puniſhed for it: And this acception of the phraſe we find elſewhere, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p>I paſſe on unto the <hi>third</hi> particular <hi>how this makes againſt the indifferency of humane actions</hi> conſidered in their ſingular and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exiſtence: I <hi>anſwere:</hi> becauſe it concludes againſt <hi>the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> of any words of men; for thoſe words, which in the generall, and in their own nature are indifferent: yet as drawn into exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and putting on circumſtances they are idle, if they have no goodneſſe adjoyned unto them, by reference unto their due, and requiſite ends: And if they be idle they are ſinfull, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not indifferent: And what is ſaid of idle words of men is applyable unto the idle thoughts, and workes of men: for the thought of man is a more rationall act then his ſpeech, more an act of reaſon: And his rationall works proceed from his thoughts, and are of farre greater moment and importance then his words: and ſo in the upſhot we may inferre that if mens idle words are not indifferent, then neither mens idle thoughts, and works: And the juſtneſſe of this inference, I ſhall confirme by two arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Idle words are therefore ſinfull, becauſe (being the birth and product of reaſon, and the free will of man) <hi>there is not in them propounded an end ſuitable unto the reaſonable nature of man:</hi> Now all the vaine thoughts, and idle works of men are the iſſue of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and freedome of will: and therefore, (becauſe they are not referred unto ſuch an honeſt end, as becomes the dignity of ſuch a rationall creature, as man,) they are faultie and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Idle words are therefore morally evill: becauſe in them, <hi>that precious treaſure, time, is waſted,</hi> in which a man may be more
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102374:29"/>laviſh, then in the moſt prodigall miſpence of money: But now our time is vainly conſumed to no good end, and purpoſe, in our idle thoughts, and works: and therefore they are ſinfull, as well as our idle words: and conſequently not indifferent.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond place is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye doe, do all unto the Glory of God:</hi> To eat, and to drinke <hi>abſtractively conſidered,</hi> are indifferent actions, and yet ſuch actions are here commanded to be referred unto the glory of God: and therefore if they be not thus referred, they are ſinfull: And we may ſay the ſame of all other actions, that are <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> in their own nature indifferent. <hi>Capreolus</hi> (lib. 2. diſt. 40. quaeſt 1. pag. 562.) noteth, that theſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>[Let all things be done unto the Glory of God]</hi> may be underſtood two manner of waies <hi>negatively or affirmatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> and then the ſenſe is, do nothing againſt Gods glory, nothing that may diſhonour him: Things offered unto idols were in themſelves the good creatures of God, and to eate them an action in it ſelfe indifferent, but to eate them in the Idols Temple was to countenance Idolatry, and ſo a high diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, To eat them alſo with the ſcandall of a weake bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was to prejudice, and <hi>obſtruct the</hi> glorifying of Gods name.</p>
                  <p>2dly, The words may be underſtood <hi>affirmatively,</hi> and ſo there is (as <hi>Capreolus</hi> obſerveth) a threefold reference unto the glory of God.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An habituall reference</hi> there is unto the glory of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is the habit, the grace, or vertue of the love of God, the principle of actually referring all things unto the glory of God. But now <hi>this is not ſufficient:</hi> for the habit of love may (for a long time) lie idle, and un-active, and be conſiſtent with very groſſe ſins: as we ſee in <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An action is <hi>actually referred</hi> unto Gods glory, when there is an actuall cogitation of God, and his glory: And this, (though it ought frequently to be done) is not yet required in every action: well it may be our happineſſe in the next life; But it can not be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102374:29"/>our duty in this; becauſe it would leave no roome, or place for other duties: Thus for an Artiſt to be alwaies thinking upon the rules of his Art, would be a diſturbance unto his worke: for a traveller to have perpetually in his thoughts, the end of his journey would retard his progreſſe therein.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>third</hi> place therefore, the reference of all our actions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods glory, that is here exhorted to, is onely <hi>virtuall.</hi> And that an action may virtually be referred unto Gods glory <hi>three things</hi> are required. 1. The above mentioned <hi>habituall reference</hi> unto Gods glory muſt be preſuppoſed, as alſo. 2dly, A forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>actuall reference of a mans ſelfe, and all that belongs unto him</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glory of God, and the more frequent this is, the better, and 3ly, <hi>The Action</hi> it ſelfe. 1. <hi>Muſt not be referred unto any end op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> unto Gods glory. 2. <hi>It muſt be referred unto ſome end ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> unto Gods glory, that carrieth a tendency unto it, and is naturally referrible thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch an action is ſaid to be <hi>virtually</hi> referred unto Gods glory, becauſe it is done in the virtue, and force of ſome prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>actuall, and explicite</hi> propoſall of Gods glory as a ſupreame end: for the virtue, and force of the chiefe, and utmoſt end abideth in all inferiour ends ſubordinated unto it; ſo that he, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds unto himſelfe thoſe inferiour ends, may be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>implicitly,</hi> and <hi>mediately</hi> Gods glory for his uttermoſt end. Thus thoſe godly perſons who have firſt actually made Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, the maine ayme of their deſires, endeavours, and undertakings, may be ſaid afterwards to referre even their eating, and drinking, their recreations unto Gods glory <hi>virtually,</hi> if they ayme at no diſhoneſt end, though their explicit and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intendment be onely the refreſhment of their bodies, by which they are the better fitted, and prepared for the glorifying of God in both their generall, and particular callings. Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtep in a mans journey, (ſo he goe not out of the way) may be ſaid to be <hi>virtually</hi> deſigned unto the end of his journey, and yet it is neither neceſſary, nor expedient, that in every ſtep a man ſhould have actuall thoughts of the end of his journey.</p>
                  <p>Unto this ſentence of the Apoſtle here, <hi>Eſtius</hi> makes Parallel two other places.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall therefore paſſe on unto a <hi>ſecond argument taken from the rule of humane actions, right reaſon:</hi> Unto this rule all rationall actions, proceeding from deliberate reaſon, are either <hi>agreeable,</hi> or <hi>diſagreeable:</hi> If <hi>agreeable,</hi> then they are morally good; for right reaſon is a part of Scripture <hi>materially</hi> conſidered: If <hi>diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,</hi> then they are vitious and ſinfull; For the will of man is bound to looke to it's rule, and conforme all it's actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and therefore if in any thing it neglect, or thwart it, if it <hi>ſwarve</hi> therefrom in the leaſt particulars, it thereby commits a ſinne.</p>

No ſpecificall nature but hath at leaſt one individuall: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if there be ſome humane actions, that be in their ſpecies, in their ſpecificall nature indifferent, there muſt needs be an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall of ſuch an action, that muſt be indifferent: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all humane actions conſidered in the individuall are not moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, or evill.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Matter of humiliation for the time paſt:</hi> In their ſingular, and actuall exiſtence they were morally either good or evill, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified or ſinnefull; and good they could not be, unleſſe there did concurre all requiſites: And (alas,) how ſeldome hath there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in them ſuch a concurrence? ſometimes they have riſen from a wrong principle; other times they have been directed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bad ends: moſt times they have been faulty in regard of either meaſure, or manner: It is very ſeldome, but there hath been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in them ſome circumſtance, or other, that the word of God, or law of nature requireth: And the <hi>totall</hi> want of one of the leaſt of ſuch circumſtances will ſo vitiate indifferent actions, as that it will not onely render them ſinfull, but make them ſinnes, meritorious of all the flames, and torments in hell: and that which deſerves ſo ſevere a puniſhment, calls for a very eminent ſorrow and contrition: God hath ſet bounds unto the uſe of our liberty in things indifferent, (as unto the waves of the ſea,) ſaying, thus farre ſhall ye goe, and no farther: He hath commanded, that it ſhould be reſtrained by <hi>prudence, Temperance, conſcience, Religion, Authority, and charity;</hi> But we have tranſgreſſed theſe limits, and have exceeded all bounds of moderation: We have uſed this part of our Chriſtian liberty very imprudently, and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in regard of our ſelves; irreligiouſly, and profanely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God: againſt the dictates of our conſcience, a deputy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; againſt the obligations of our oathes, and vowes unto him: diſobediently againſt the lawfull commands of our ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: uncharitably with the ſcandall of many poore brethren. And thus have we moſt ſhamefully, and unthankfully abuſed this great priviledg of Chriſtianity, by uſing it as an <hi>occaſion unto the fleſh,</hi> as a <hi>cloake of maliciouſneſſe;</hi> and ſo have proſtituted it unto the very ſervice of Satan himſelfe: <hi>When</hi> Job's <hi>Sons and Daughters had feaſted together,</hi> Job <hi>offered burnt offerings according unto the number of them all: for he ſaid, it may be that my ſonnes have ſinned, Job.</hi> 14.5. Their feaſting was a thing indifferent, and very lawfull
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102374:32"/>in it ſelfe: but, becauſe it was obnoxious unto ſinne, therefore <hi>Jobe</hi> ſacrificed in the behalfe of them all: It may be (ſaith he) <hi>that my ſonnes have ſinned:</hi> The <hi>poſſibility</hi> of ſinne in the indifferent things of <hi>others</hi> (eſpecially ſuch as are neerly related:) ſtirs up in the godly a feare, and a holy jealouſy of them, and rowſeth unto prayers for them: and therefore much more ſhould the <hi>certaine,</hi> and undoubted aſſurance of the adheſion of ſinne unto our <hi>own</hi> indifferent actions provoke us, with contrite hearts to deprecate the wrath of God againſt us: All the indifferencies of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are ſinnes: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure,</hi> Tit. 1.15. <hi>the plowing of the wicked is ſinne,</hi> Prov. 21.4.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The liableneſſe of our indifferent actions unto ſinne ſhould be a motive unto all poſſible <hi>caution and warineſſe for the future</hi> in them: There is no humane action ſo indifferent, but it is capable of ſinne, nay (if it be not in all particulars rightly circumſtantiated,) it becomes actually ſinfull; and therefore our hearts ſhould be very watchfull againſt ſinne in the uſe of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies, in our meales, in our feaſtings, and merry meetings, in our journey's, in our ordinary talke, and diſcourſe, in our walkes, in the actions of our ordinary vocations: <hi>Indeed the rule of Gods word doth not at all either command, or forbid the matter of ſuch actions: but the manner of performing them commeth under the rule:</hi> They are all to be done to the glory of God, in the name of Chriſt: every good creature is to be ſanctified by the word, and prayer: That Command, which God gave Abraham <hi>(to walk before him)</hi> is not to be ſtraitned unto the ordinances of God, but to be extended unto all deliberate acts of a mans life, and converſation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Zechariah</hi> (in his prophecy of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall call or converſion of Jewes, and Gentiles) gives this for one
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102374:32"/>character of ſuch, as ſhall be converted, that they ſhall have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſanctified uſe of things common and indifferent: <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the bells of their horſes, holineſſe unto the Lord, yea, every pot in Jeruſalem and Judah ſhall be holineſſe unto the Lord of Hoſts, Zech.</hi> 14.20, 21. Not onely acts of immediate worſhip, but all rationall actions, whatſoever, ſhould be offered up <hi>as ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable unto God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. The Apoſtle exhorts the Romans to <hi>ſalute one another with an holy kiſſe, Rom.</hi> 16.16. this kiſſe was no religious rite in Gods worſhip, but a ceremony of civility; and therefore in it ſelfe a thing indifferent: And yet the Apoſtle requires holineſſe for the qualification of it: All our civill actions ought to be ſuch, as becommeth ſaints; that is, ſo farre forth holy for manner, that they be free from ſinne, and unto the glory of God: Indeed this is a ſtrictneſſe impoſſible unto lapſed man: But though we cannot <hi>exactly and perfectly</hi> obſerve it, yet we may <hi>ſincerely and cordially</hi> endeavour it: And this ſincere and hearty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is that, which God, for Chriſt's ſake, will accept, reward, and crowne; and therefore it concernes us very much to uſe our utmoſt diligence herein: and the rather, becauſe we are (by farre) more prone and ready to ſlide into ſinne in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ere we are aware, then in ſuch things, as are for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and matter ſinfull; for in ſuch things the danger is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and therefore the more feared, and watcht againſt; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if once we know, and are perſwaded, that actions are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and lawfull, then we are apt to think that all is ſafe, and that we need not trouble our ſelves with any farther conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching their expediency, and edification; and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> there is no reaſon to perplex our hearts and conſcience with an anxious care of referring them to Gods glory, of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God in them, and of putting holyneſſe unto the Lord upon them. Now when once ſuch thoughts as theſe creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens heads, it cannot be imagined, unto what exceſſes, and failings it expoſeth them: Adde unto this: that looke as the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the lawfulneſſe, and indifferency of actions occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a ſurprizall many times with hainous ſinnes: ſo alſo it proves <hi>(by accident)</hi> an obſtacle unto repentance for ſuch ſinnes: When the Godly fall into groſſe, and acknowledged ſinnes, either of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102374:33"/>or commiſſion; why, the checks of their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the publick miniſtery, the reproaches of enemies, and the admonition of Chriſtian friends will ſoone awaken them, and informe them of their guilt: But as for the ſinnes, that adhere unto their indifferencies, how quickly are they hardened in them? For it is very ſeldome, that, either their conſciences, or their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or their Brethren take notice of them; or if they doe, they are apt preſently to hold forth the indifferencie, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſuch actions in themſelves, as a buckler to ward off all accuſations of Conſcience, all upbraidings of enemies, all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, of either miniſters, or private friends: Thoſe, that are moſt laviſh of their time, and purſes, in gaming, will plead; that they follow none, but lawfull ſports: A Gentleman, that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the greateſt part of his time in hunting, hawking, and the like exerciſes, and redeems but an inconſiderable portion of it to do God, and his Countrey ſervice, thinks, that he hath enough to ſtopp the mouth of all reproofe, to ſay, that the recreations, which he purſueth are things indifferent: ſuch riotous perſons, as waſt their pretious houres in joviallity, and goodfellowſhip, uſually make this Apology for themſelves: that it is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to drinke with a friend in a Taverne or alehouſe. To awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from this licentiouſneſſe, and to quicken in us a carefull watchfulneſſe over our hearts in the uſe of things indifferent, I ſhall, for concluſion of this diſcourſe, propound ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ſeverity of Gods judgments againſt the ſinnes of mens indifferencies: <hi>Davids</hi> numbering of the people was a thing not evill <hi>in it ſelfe;</hi> but his curioſity, pride, and carnall confidence in an arme of fleſh made it ſo; And God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with this thing, <hi>therefore he ſmote Iſrael,</hi> 1 Chron. 21.7. <hi>with a peſtilence, that devoured</hi> 70000. Doubtleſſe moſt of thoſe feminine ornaments (mentioned, <hi>Eſay</hi> 3.) were in themſelves lawfull; but the haughtineſſe, and wantonneſſe of the daughters of Zion abuſed them unto ſinne; And how ſeverely this ſinfull abuſe of them was threatned, you may read at large from <hi>verſe the</hi> 16 <hi>uſque ad</hi> 25: for Hezekiah to ſhew unto the Babylonian Ambaſſadours <hi>the houſe of his pretious things, the ſilver, and the gold and the ſpices, and the pretious oyntment, and all the houſe of his armour, and all that was found in his treaſures,</hi> all that was remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102374:33"/>in his houſe, and dominion was in it ſelfe, but a civill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and not unlawfull: but becauſe he did it out of vaine oſtentation, this turned it into ſinne, and this was one of the ſins, which God chaſtiſed with the captivity of the whole nation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 39 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 30. <hi>To be cloathed in Purple, and fine linnen, and to fare ſumptuouſly</hi> were things in themſelves indifferent; but the exceſſe of the rich glutton made it ſinfull unto him: and this ſinne, not being repented of, was unto him a forerunner of hell torments, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19, 23. They were the ſinnes of things indifferent that had a great hand in, and influence upon the drowning of the old world, and the burning of Sodome, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28, 29. <hi>In the daies of</hi> Noah, <hi>they did eat, they dranke, they married wives, they were given in marriage, untill the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the arke; and the flood came and deſtroyed them all.

                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> ſuppoſe the primary ſcope and intention of the Apoſtle be limited unto matters of doctrine: yet becauſe the maine reaſon, for which they themſelves conceive appearances of evill, even in matters of doctrine to be interdicted, is avoidance of ſcandall, the precept of which is <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and not only doctrines but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo actions are ſcandalous: juſtly therefore unto theſe, as well as thoſe, is the text appliable, and applied too, by all Schoolmen, or others that ever I met with purpoſely treating on the point of ſcandall. Should we then againſt the more generally received opinion of either former or later times, admit of their narrow and curtaild interpretation for the cleare, and indubitate ſenſe of the Apoſtle? Yet to make the words more inſtructive, their uſe more generall, we might warrantably put an enlargment upon them, and extend them <hi>ad mores,</hi> as well as <hi>ad dogmata: ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda,</hi> as well as <hi>ad credenda:</hi> to the decalogue, as well as <hi>creed;</hi> not onely to doctrinall truthes, but morall duties alſo.</p>

                  <p>Note <hi>firſt,</hi> that though the ſubſtance or matter of Doctrines appeare to be falſe unto our ſelves, our own judgments, yet are we not bound to abſtaine poſitively from aſſenting to them, to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102374:39"/>diſſent from them, to reject them; for this appearance may not be true and reall, grounded upon the doctrines themſelves, which perhaps may not ſend forth the leaſt colour or ſhadow for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, but only put and faſtned upon them by means of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ignorance, and darkneſſe of our underſtandings, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not with due care and circumſpection, but rather with much precipitancy have given their cenſure of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore however at firſt bluſh they ſeeme falſe, yet when once the light of our reaſon is cleared from miſts, and clouds, they may upon due examination prove true: and to diſſent from, and reject a truth would be a foule errour of, and blemiſh to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.

And thus you ſee how farre Chriſtian modeſty requireth us to abſtaine from aſſenting to doctrines upon the appearance of evill, or falſhood, which they carry unto thoſe, who in interpeting ſcripture, and deciding controverſies, have committed to them the publick office <hi>of direction and</hi> inſtruction of others: but yet it taketh not from us the <hi>judgment of private diſcretion;</hi> for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty alloweth us ſuch a freedome of diſſenting from, or aſſenting unto, what the Church, and her miniſters ſay, as is to be ſpecified in the next two following rules.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>third</hi> place therefore, although the Church, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and cheifeſt part of her, charge errour and falſhood upon ſuch a doctrine, yet this bare and ſingle teſtimony, not ſeconded by any ſcripture or reaſon, is not to gaine ſo farre upon our beliefe, as that thereupon we ſhould preſently reject, and diſſent from the doctrine thus generally cenſured with an abſolute and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102374:40"/>diſſent. This were to give unto the Churches deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as high and over-ruling a ſuffrage in our hearts, as is onely due to divine revelations to receive them, not as they are indeed the word of men, but as if they were the word of God: to yeild unto them an abſolute divine faith, and credence. This were a meere <hi>Vaſſallage</hi> of our ſoules, underſtandings, faiths, unto the authority of an humane teſtimony: a thing utterly unworthy the generoſity and freedome of Chriſtian Spirits. If God hath indulged to any the exerciſe of ſuch dominion over mens faiths, and conſciences: alas! then to what purpoſe hath he placed that glorious lamp of reaſon in our boſomes? of what uſe are our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualls?</hi> What place is there left for St <hi>Pauls proving of all things?</hi> St <hi>John's tryall of the Spirits?</hi> but the truth is,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1.</note> that God is ſo farre from enſlaving our underſtandings, or captivating our beliefe unto the judgment of any mortall, as that he approves not onely of a forbearance from a flat, and abſolute <hi>diſſent</hi> from doubtfull doctrines thus publickly, and generally diſliked, but alſo of a full and peremptory aſſent unto doctrines manifeſtly true, though condemned in a generall Councill, as is apparent from the fourth and <hi>laſt rule,</hi> which is:</p>
                  <p>If a doctrine be, as true in it ſelfe, ſo alſo clearly, and evidently by me apprehended to be ſo, and yet appeare generally to be falſe unto others, of what degree, order, or condition ſoever; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it Commands abſolute ſubſcription, and aſſent of the mind without <hi>contradiction,</hi> without <hi>heſitancy,</hi> nay without ſo much as <hi>ſuſpenſe</hi> of judgment. If the verity then of a doctrine be apparent, it muſt over-rule the aſſent of the underſtanding againſt the teſtimony of the whole world. For the teſtimony of men, of the wiſeſt, holieſt men, conſidered either apart, or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in a councill, admits, as allwaies of <hi>examination,</hi> and tryall by the ballance of the Sanctuary, and rules of right reaſon, ſo likewiſe of <hi>contradiction</hi> and denyall, when in it there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and evident variation from either reaſon, or divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In ſuch a cauſe we may lawfully, and ſafely diſſent from it; allwaies provided, that it be not in an inſolent manner, but with a reverend, child-like, and reſpectfull baſhfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But to goe on, if I am not to abſtaine from aſſenting to a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine manifeſtly true, becauſe it appeares generally to others to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102374:41"/>be falſe, muſt I not yet abſtaine from <hi>publiſhing,</hi> from <hi>ſpreading</hi> of it, either by writing or preaching?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, thou muſt conſider the generall nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the doctrine, thus wrongly either <hi>accuſed,</hi> or <hi>ſuſpected</hi> of <hi>falſhood,</hi> and alſo of what uſe, and importance it is in regard of the preſent times, and places, wherein thou liveſt, and if it prove to be a doctrine either fundamentall, or at leaſt of ſuch weight and moment that from the publiſhing of it, will ſpring a greater good, more glory to God, and benefits to the Church then the trouble and diſquiet it brings can be an evill, thou art then at no hand to conceale it, ſo ſhould'ſt thou be unfaithfull both to God and his Church, and become acceſſary to the betraying, nay murther of the truth. <hi>Si de veritate ſcandalum ſumatur</hi> (ſaith Gregory) <hi>melius eſt ut ſcandalum oriatur, quam ut veritas relinquatur.</hi> If ſcandall or offence be taken at a truth which the eſtate and exigence of thoſe ſoules committed to a mans charge requireth him to publiſh, better ſuffer the whole world to be ſcandalized, than ſuch a truth diſadvantaged, either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, or but a cowardly ſmothering, and diſſembling, thereof. <q>

The word <hi>Sacrament</hi> with the ancients ſounded no other, than an holy ſignificant rite; in thoſe times then to have called matrimony, orders, &amp;c. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had been (it may be) without all manner of offence. But now, ſince the Church of Rome hath peremptorily determined, that therebe <hi>Seaven Sacraments properly</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſo called, ſeaven outward and ſenſible ſignes, which by divine inſtitution, have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto them the promiſe of juſtifying grace. He that ſhall now terme any thing a Sacrament, beſides <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> renders himſelfe thereby juſtly ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>In the writings of the Fathers, the words of ſatisfaction, and merit have been of large uſe. Satisfaction ſignified every bitter afflictive acknowledgment, or penitentiall mortification of our ſins, whereby we prevent, and turne away God's hand, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for them. <hi>Merit,</hi> denoted onely <hi>obtaining, procurement, impetration,</hi> and according to this acception of the words, a man might ſafely have heretofore affirmed, that our prayers, almes, and other good works are ſatisfactory and meritorious. But now ſince ſome of the Romaniſts have wreſted theſe ſayings of the Fathers unto a worſe ſenſe, than they were uttered in: and hereupon taught that works are properly <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> juſt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi> for our ſins, wherein we make recompence unto Gods wronged juſtice, and redeeme our ſelves at leaſt from <hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments; that works are <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> meritorious of eternall life, deſerving and earning it <hi>ex condigno,</hi> in the way of condigne wages; as if there were an equality or due proportion between it and them, without all regard unto Gods gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them; he that ſhall now averre theſe propoſitions, may without breach of charity be juſtly thought to embrace

                  <p>But now (to proceed unto a <hi>ſecond reaſon</hi>) beſides the evill of ſcandall in actions, that carry a reall appearance of evill, there is alſo <hi>reductivè</hi> the guilt of that evill of which they have an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for that command, which forbids ſuch a ſin, forbids all the ſhewes and occaſions of it, all the preparatives unto it; as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerved by Commentators upon the Decalogue. Thus the prohibition of adultery takes in all the cauſes, and ſignes thereof: by this rule to ſit at meat in the Idols Temple, at the Idols feaſt, was not onely a ſin of ſcandall, as being a provocation unto, and ſo a participation of the ſin of Idolatry in weake and ignorant ſpectators; but alſo a ſin of Idolatry by way <hi>of reduction,</hi> a ſinne againſt religion, a tranſgreſſion againſt that worſhip, which God requireth. <hi>Suarez</hi> expreſſeth this, though ſomewhat obſcurely, yet more fully: firſt he layeth down this concluſion; <hi>Quando ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis indirectè inducit alium ad peccandum per actionem malam, vel habentem ſpeciem mali, etiam incurrit ſpecialem malitiam ſcandali:</hi> againſt this concluſion he propounds amongſt others this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Sequitur eum &amp;c. per actionem non malam, ſed habentem ſpeciem mali contrahere duas malitias. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nam ſcandali contra charitatem: aliam illius ſpeciei peccati, ad quam proximus inducitur.

                  <p>Errour in <hi>matter of Law, right,</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> is againe twofold, either in regard of <hi>law naturall,</hi> or <hi>law poſitive.</hi> Now unto all that have actuall uſe of reaſon, The errour of the law of nature is vinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and voluntary; becauſe the law of nature is ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated unto them, it is written in their hearts, <hi>Rom:</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p>And we may ſay the ſame of Chriſtians, that enjoy the plenary promulgation of the Goſpell, and are capable of underſtanding it: for the Goſpell ſufficiently reveales all divine poſitives; ſo that a rationall man may know them, and is bound to know them; and <hi>Aquinas ſtates it rightly.</hi> 1.2<hi>dae. q.</hi> 19. <hi>art</hi> 6. <hi>voluntas concordans ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni erranti circaea, quae quis ſcire tenetur, ſemper eſt mala:</hi> If a man erre concerning ſuch things, as he may know, and is bound to know, ſuch an errour is (at leaſt <hi>indirectè</hi>) voluntary, and ſinfull, and cannot oblige.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Third exception</hi> ſhall be the objection of <hi>Durand</hi> in the place above quoted: <hi>Sola vera notitia de re obligationem non t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The moſt conſiderable objection is that of <hi>Becanus</hi> [Sum: Theol. 2. part. p. 1. tom. 2. tract. 1. cap. 4.] <hi>Durandus concedit illum p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102374:50"/>great wonder, that I was prejudiced againſt them: But, about the beginning of the long Parliament, being awakened with the generall complaint of the Godly againſt the Ceremonies, I began to thinke a new of the controverſy, and out of my former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice intended a full vindication of the diſcipline, and Ceremonies of the then Church of England: and in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I read all ſuch books of the non-conformiſt's as I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: for I knew well by experience, that a controverſy can never be well handled, unleſſe all diſſenting opinions thereabouts be weighed: but upon peruſall of the non-conformiſts I ſoone found: that their adverſaries moſt diſingeniouſly miſrepreſented all that they ſaid: that they reſuſed to joine iſſue with them in the ſtate of the Queſtion: that they came not up to an orderly grapple with their arguments: and that they ſeldome regularly replyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſolutions, which were given unto their objections: and this quickly produced an alteration in my judgment, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will do ſo too in all, that will make ſuch an impartiall ſearch into the matter, as I have done.</p>

                  <p>For the better ſtating of this Queſtion, I ſhall premiſe ſome diſtinctions of ſcandall: a ſcandall <hi>is either active</hi> or <hi>paſſive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An active</hi> ſcandall is in all ſuch words, or deeds, as culpably oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the fall of another <hi>into</hi> ſin: and this is againe by <hi>Gregory
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102374:50"/>de Valentia</hi> [tom. 3. diſp. 3. q. 18. punct. 1.] rightly <hi>ſubdivided into that which is</hi> per ſe, <hi>and into that which is</hi> per accidens.</p>
                  <p>An active ſcandall <hi>perſe</hi> is in ſuch publique acts, as either by the expreſſe intent of the agent, or from their nature, and in themſelves, are <hi>inductive</hi> unto ſinne: and they are againe <hi>twofold:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> all publick ſinnes, or ſinnes committed before another:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> all ſuch publick actions, as carry a reall and manifeſt appearance of ſin.</p>
                  <p>An active ſcandall <hi>per accidens</hi> is in ſuch things, as are not in themſelves, and in their own nature occaſions of ſin unto another: and this is, either in an <hi>unſeaſonable performance of poſitive duties,</hi> commanded by affirmative precepts, which are not neceſſary <hi>hic &amp; nunc:</hi> or elſe by an <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> uſe <hi>of our liberty in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Paſſive ſcandall</hi> is the fall of another into ſinne: and this (by the author but now mentioned) is ſubdivided into <hi>given,</hi> and <hi>taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandalum datum, a paſſive ſcandall given, is</hi> that which ariſeth truly from the active ſcandall of another, as from its <hi>morall cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandalum acceptum, a paſſive ſcandall</hi> that is onely <hi>taken,</hi> is that which is onely the fault of the party ſcandalized, and cannot be imputed to any other, as a morall cauſe: the words or deeds of another may be an <hi>occaſion</hi> of it, but not a <hi>culpable occaſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire that theſe diſtinctions of ſcandall may be well heeded: for the want of Conſideration of them hath occaſioned a great deale of confuſion in mens diſcourſes about ſcandall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> many exclude from active ſcandall all things that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize <hi>per accidens:</hi> and then, what will become of thoſe ſcandals <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks againſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ch. 8. ch. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, moſt confound a paſſive ſcandall with <hi>ſcandalum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum,</hi> a ſcandall that is onely taken, and make them to be of an equall extent: whereas a paſſive ſcandall may de diſtributed into both given, and taken: if it be culpably both given, and taken: then it is <hi>ſcandalum datum:</hi> if it be culpably taken, and not culpably gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then it is <hi>ſcandalum acceptum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, theſe diſtinctions being thus premiſed: I ſuppoſe it will be agreed upon by all ſides: that the queſtion is to be underſtood. <hi>Firſt</hi> of active ſcandals, our ſcandalizing of the wicked: or <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:102374:51"/>(which comes all to one) of ſuch paſſive ſcandals of them, as are given by us, as well as taken by them: Not, <hi>thirdly,</hi> of ſuch paſſive ſcandals, as are onely taken by them, not given by us: for from the guilt of theſe we may waſh our hands, ſo that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us to forbeare thoſe things, by which they are in this manner ſcandalized.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Concluſion</hi> ſhall be: that we are to eſchew the active ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and conſequently <hi>ſcandala paſſiva data,</hi> of the wicked, and malitious, thoſe that are Phariſaicall and willfull ſpirits: this is apparent: <hi>Firſt</hi> from <hi>Paul's</hi> prohibition of ſcandall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Give none offence neither to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> he ſpake of unconverted Jewes, and Gentiles, ſuch as were enemies unto the Chriſtian faith: and the Jewes were of all men the moſt malitious enemies thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> from our Saviours denunciation of a woe unto the world by meanes of ſcandall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Woe unto the world becauſe of offences;</hi> which undeniably is to be extended unto all ſorts of men.</p>
                  <p>Unto theſe two <hi>arguments</hi> we may adde <hi>foure other,</hi> taken from, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>diſtribution;</hi> Secondly, <hi>relation;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>effect;</hi> Fourthly, <hi>oppoſite of an active</hi> ſcandall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, from the diſtribution of an active ſcandall,</hi> and peruſall of the members thereof: An active ſcandall (as I ſhewed but now) is diſtributed into <hi>ſcandalum per ſe,</hi> and <hi>per accidens:</hi> now there is no doubt, but that we are carefully to avoid ſuch things as ſcandalize the wicked, and malicious <hi>per ſe,</hi> of themſelves, and in their own nature, <hi>publick ſins, or ſuch words, and deeds as have a reall appearance of ſin:</hi> all the queſtion will be concerning ſuch things as ſcandalize them onely <hi>per accidens, our duties, and our indifferencies:</hi> and by theſe they are frequently ſcandalized, and that out of an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion concerning their unlawfulneſſe: in which regard the reſolution will be pertinent unto the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then: <hi>duties,</hi> that are commanded by affirmative precepts, may be forborne, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> ſometimes, and in ſome places, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide the ſcandall of the wicked, and malitious. The uſuall inſtances are in reproofe, admonition, puniſhment of ſin, and the like: and this is warranted</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the precept of our <hi>Saviour, Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Give not that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102374:51"/>which is holy unto the dogs: neither caſt ye your pearles before ſwine: leſt they trample them under their feet, and turne againe and rent you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the example of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39.1, 2. <hi>I will keep my tongue with a bridle, while the wicked is before me: I was dumb with ſilence, I held my peace even from good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by that rule in Divinity; <hi>affirmativa praecepta obligant ſemper, non ad ſemper;</hi> they alwaies bind, but not to alwayes: they do not oblige to doe the things required at all times, but only, when they are expedient for the glory of God, and the good of others: To reprove, and admoniſh ſinners is a duty commanded by God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou ſhalt in anywiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> But now this duty is not to be performed unſeaſonably, when tis likely to bring no glory to <hi>God,</hi> nor good unto others, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likely to ſcandalize them. Thus every private man is not bound to runne into an ale-houſe, or taverne, there to reprehend a company of deſperate drunkards, who would looke upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion as an act of pragmaticalneſſe, and inſolency, and for it be ready to quoite him downe the Staires, or run him through with their ſwords: and as imprudent an act would it be, <hi>in Spaine,</hi> to run into their Churches, and there to cry againſt the Idolatry of the Maſſe; and in the Streets of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nſtantinople</hi> to declame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impoſtures of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> for hereby we ſhould ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize them indiſcreetly, and fooliſhly occaſion them, as to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme our religion, ſo to cut us in peices.</p>
                  <p>Unto the forementioned rule in <hi>Divinity</hi> I ſhall adde another out of <hi>Logick; finis dat mediis amabilitatem: 'tis the end onely makes the meanes deſireable:</hi> Now reproofe, admonition, puniſhment, and the like duties are enjoined as meanes, in order to the reformation, and bettering of others: when therefore they are not likely to conduce unto this end, but rather to oppoſe and hinder it, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſuch a caſe dictates an abſtinence from them. But let us take two exemplifications of this out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> 2. 2<hi>dae. q.</hi> 43. <hi>art.</hi> 7. The firſt is concerning the puniſhment of ſin: <hi>dicendum, quòd poenarum inflictio non eſt propter ſe expetenda: ſed poenae infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur, ut medicinae quaedam ad cohibenda pecc. ta, &amp; ideò in tantum habent rationem juſtitiae, in quantum per eas peccata cohibentur.

                  <p>But to proceed next to the ſcandall of the wicked by our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies:</hi> That we are to forbear things indifferent when they ſcandalize the wicked, and malitious. <hi>Parker</hi> [in his treatiſe of <hi>the Croſſe part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 57.] proves by many inſtances: when <hi>the thing was indifferent, doth not our Saviour foregoe his liberty, to pleaſe the malicious? as when he paid tribute leſt he ſhould offend them? Matth.</hi> 17.27. They <hi>were malicious at Corinth, and ſeek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt</hi> Paul, <hi>that were likely to be offended by his taking of wages there: yet the thing, being no neceſſary duty, he thinketh it his duty to forbeare his power therein,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. The <hi>Heathens are malicious to take offence, when Chriſtians go to Law for their own: yet, becauſe going to law is not a duty neceſſary, it muſt be forborne, and Chriſtians rather muſt looſe their own, then give occaſion of ſcandall to them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. v. 6, 7. Unto theſe examples let me adde another (quoted by the ſame authour elſewhere) out of <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.22. <hi>I was aſhamed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezra) to require of the King a band of Souldiers and horſemen, to help us againſt the enemies in the way: becauſe we had ſpok n unto the King, ſaying, the hand of our God is upon all them for good, that ſeeke him, but his power and his wrath is againſt all them that forſake him</hi> Here for <hi>Ezra</hi> to have asked of the King of Perſia, a Heathen, a band of ſouldiers, and horſemen for his ſafe conduct, was a thing lawfull: and yet he forbore it, leſt he ſhould ſcandalize him by begetting in him a ſuſpicion, that that was falſe, which he had told him concerning Gods power, and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> argument is drawn from the <hi>relation</hi> of an active ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall: it is the morall cauſe of a paſſive ſcandall; ſo that he who ſcandalizeth another, partaketh of, and is acceſſary unto the ſin of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102374:52"/>the party ſcandalized, and we are not to <hi>partake of,</hi> or be acceſſary unto the <hi>ſins of any,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>We muſt have no fellowſhip with unfruitfull works of darkneſſe</hi> in any whomſoever, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſ.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>third</hi> argument is fetcht from the <hi>effect</hi> of an active ſcandall: 'tis of a ſoule deſtroying nature, &amp; ſo a kind of ſpirituall murther: <hi>deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died, Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>for meat deſtroy not the works of God, verſ.</hi> 20. and who ſhould not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the guilt of the murther of any ſoul whatſoever? for there is no ſoule ſo wicked, but may (for ought thou knoweſt) be one <hi>of thoſe, for whom</hi> Chriſt ſhed his moſt divine, and precious blood.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> argument is taken from the <hi>Oppoſite</hi> of ſcandall, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and its act <hi>beneficence:</hi> We are <hi>to love all,</hi> even our moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, and perſecuting enemies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. We are to do <hi>good unto all,</hi> though <hi>eſpecially to the houſhold of faith, Gal.</hi> 6.10. We are to exerciſe <hi>patience, and meekneſſe,</hi> towards even thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14, 15. And from this it will inevitably follow, that we are to ſcandalize none.</p>
                  <p>Here we have uſually objected the example of our Saviour, who ſlighted the ſcandall of the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.12, 13, 14. <hi>Then came his Diſciples and ſaid unto him: knoweſt thou that tho Phariſees were offended</hi> after they heard this ſaying? but he anſwered and ſaid &amp;c. let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The objection concernes onely the ſcandalizing of them in things indifferent; and unto it I ſhall give an anſwer in the words of <hi>Parker</hi> part 2. part. 57. <hi>If this be all the warrant we have, not to forbeare in a thing indifferent for the malicious, then have we no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at all, becauſe the ſcandall (there) not cared for, is when the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees are offended, at his abſtaining from their waſhings, and his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of a true doctrine: both of which were neceſſary duties for him to doe. And when he defendeth his healing on ſabbaths, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples plucking eares, upon this reaſon they are duties of neceſſity and charity, he plainly inſinuateth, there is no defence for deeds unneceſſary, when the malitious are ſcandalized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a <hi>ſecond</hi> place I ſhall alleadge the Objection of the Schoole-men which by <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> is thus urged [<hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>diſp.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 18. <hi>punct.</hi> 4.] <hi>Nam qui non ex ignorantiâ, aut infirmitate, ſed ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiâ ſcandalizatur, non laborat tali aliquâ neceſſitate ſpirituali, cui
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102374:53"/>non poſſit ipſe ſine ope alterius proximi facile proſpicere mutando pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam ſuam voluntatem. Ergo alter non tenetur tunc cum ali quo ſuo detrimento proſpicere.</hi> Phariſees, the wicked, that are ſcandalized out of meere malice, and not out of ignorance, or weakneſſe are not in any ſuch ſpirituall neceſſity, or danger, but that they can eaſily provide for the ſafety, and indemnity of their ſoules, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help or aſſiſtance of others, by changing their depraved will: and therefore others are not bound to incurre any detriment for the prevention of their ſcandall.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer unto this may eaſily be foreſeen, for here is nothing but Jeſuiticall dictates, that are alltogether proofeleſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Phariſees, the wicked, that are ſcandalized out of malice, are in a greater ſpirituall neceſſity, and danger, then thoſe, that are ſcandalized out of ignorance, or weakneſſe: for, they are in the <hi>ſnare of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vill, taken captive by him at his will.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are more unable to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and prevent their own falling into ſin; for their hearts are altogether deſtitute of any gracious habits: there is not in them the ſpirit, a renewed principle, to make head, or reſiſtance againſt the fleſh, the ſinfull corruption of their natures: there is need then of all help poſſible to keepe them from falling: and all will be uneffectuall, unleſſe God alſo put in his helping hand.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he talkes: that 'tis an eaſy matter for a wicked, and malitious man to provide againſt all danger, and need of his ſoule, by changing his perverſe, and naughty will: this is a very groſſe Pelagian conceite: for it aſcribes that, unto the power of mans corrupt will, which can be wrought only by the omnipotent grace of God.</p>
                  <p>By this time (I hope) the Reader is ſufficiently ſatisfyed that the active ſcandals of the moſt wicked, and malitious are not to be contemned.</p>
                  <p>But yet there remaineth a great difficulty in the point to be cleared; and that is, when an active ſcandall is committed towards them, in our duties, and indifferencies?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> we actively ſcandalize them by our <hi>duties,</hi> when they are not rightly circumſtanced, ſeaſonably performed, in due time, and place: when they are not expedient unto thoſe ends, for which God enjoyned them: now when this is, cannot be determined by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102374:53"/>any generall rule, but every one muſt be left to be guided by his ſpirituall prudence, and wiſdome. [But for this hereafter I ſhall allot a peculiar digreſſion by it ſelfe.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> we actively ſcandalize them by our <hi>indifferencies,</hi> when 'tis probable they will occaſion their paſſive ſcandall, their falling into ſin; But now this generall rule is to be limited, and I ſhall give you <hi>three limitations</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt limitation:</hi> this rule is to be underſtood, when the uſe of our indifferencies is likely to prejudice, and obſtruct the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpell, and the forbearance of them will in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability conduce unto the advancement of the Credit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and not otherwiſe, ordinarily: upon this account, it would have been ſcandalous in <hi>Paul</hi> to have received maintenance from the Corinthians: but tis now unſcandalous in Miniſters, to accept, and challenge that maintenance, which is due unto them by the lawes of the land; for a generall forbearance thereof now would ſoone be followed with the utter ruine of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond limitation:</hi> the forementioned rule is to be underſtood, when the forbearance of our indifferencies is likely to win upon the wicked, and malitious, ſo as to further their converſion, and not otherwiſe, when it onely expoſeth unto their contempt, ſcorne, and deriſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Though I be free from all men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) yet have I made my ſelfe ſervant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that Imight gain the Jewes: to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gaine them that are under the Law. To them that are without Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt) that I might gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them, that are without Law. To the weake became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all meanes ſave ſome.</hi> Here tis very remarkable, that <hi>Paul</hi> was made, in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, all things unto all men, only in order to their ſalvation, to gaine their ſoules unto Chriſt; and why ſhould we abridge our ſelves in the uſe of our liberty, in things that are of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency and conveniency unto us, when ſuch a reſtraint of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is not a probable means of reaching the ſaid end? what reaſon can be given, why we ſhould incommodate our ſelves, by forbearing all ſuch indifferencies, that wicked men are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102374:54"/>at, when ſuch forbearance is unprofitable unto their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, and unlikely to bring them any jot the nearer unto God and Heaven?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A third limitation:</hi> the forementioned rule hath not place, when by the forbearance of our indifferencies, at which ſome wicked men are ſcandalized, there is incurred as great, if not a greater ſcandall, then that by their uſe: as when they are hereby confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hardned in their errour, and ſinne; and others are hereby drawn into the like: <hi>prudenter advertendum eſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) <hi>ſcandalum ſcandalo non emendari, qualis emendatio erit, ſi ut aliis ſcandalum tollas, alios ſcandalizas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how the rule is to be limited; and without ſuch, or the like limitations, rigidly to preſſe it, would make againſt both the <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, againſt the liberty of Conſcience:</hi> for it would in great part evacuate, and annull the grand charter of our Chriſtian liberty in things indifferent, it would (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in another caſe) <hi>put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples, which neither our Fathers were, nor we are able to beare,</hi> Acts 15.10. <hi>All things are lawfull for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>But I will not be brought under the power of any,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. But now if we muſt forbeare all our lawfull conveniences, at which wicked men perhaps will be purpoſely ſcandalized, we ſhould be brought under the power of them, we ſhould be little better then their ſlaves; and what an unſpeakable, and intollerable vaſſalage would that bee?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly it would make againſt the peace of Conſcience;</hi> for it would ſo perplex mens conſciences with doubts, and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as that they would hardly know when, and how to act in the uſe of things indifferent, for wicked men are very prone to be ſcandalized at the lawfull conveniencies of the Godly: and there is no doubt, but many are ſo wicked, as that they would of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nouriſh, and cheriſh ſuch ſcandals in themſelves, if they thought that the Godly would hereupon forbeare ſuch their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies: there be ſome people of ſuch malevolent ſpirits againſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102374:54"/>Miniſters, as that they are ſcandalized at the decent apparell of them, &amp; their wives, at their competent fare, and moderate houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping: and, if they muſt make the humor, and opinion of ſuch men the rule of their walking in all things indifferent, it will be a very difficult matter for them to know how herein to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this doctrine, <hi>that we are to forbeare all indifferencies, at which wicked men are ſcandalized,</hi> if it be unlimited would create perplexities, not only unto Miniſters, but unto all ſorts of men, eſpecially ſuch as have any thing due unto them from others: for grant this, and how often will a Landlord be at a loſſe to demand his rent? a Creditor his debts? and the magiſtrate his tribute or contribution?</p>
                  <p>Adde unto this, <hi>thirdly,</hi> that this doctrine, without limitation, will tend unto the overthrow of <hi>publick peace, and order,</hi> and brings in nothing but anarchy and confuſion: for publique peace and order depends much upon the preſervation of propriety: and upon what a tickliſh point would propriety ſtand, if we muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to exact, or receive all ſuch temporals, at which wicked men are ſcandalized, that can be forborne without ſin? unto what wrongs, and injuries would this expoſe ſuch, as are well affected? for there be ſome men ſo wicked and malitious, as that they would be ſcandalized at their temporals for the nonce to deprive them of them. I ſhall conclude this particular with the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aquinas</hi> 2. 2dae. q. 43. art. 8. <hi>Propter eos, qui ſic ſcandala conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, non ſunt temporalia dimittenda: quia hoc &amp; noceret bono commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni: dar tur enim malis rapiendi occaſio, &amp; noceret ipſis rapientibus, qui retinendo aliena, in peccato remanerent. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Greg. dicit in Moral.

                  </p>
                  <p>Why then it muſt be omitted, but with this caution, ſo it may be without <hi>ſin,</hi> or as the <hi>ordinary gloſſe</hi> upon that 15 of <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 12, 13, 14. reſolves it, <hi>Salvâ triplici veritate, vitae, Juſtitiae, Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> ſo the threefold verity of <hi>life, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi> be preſerved ſafe: <hi>Nam per hanc triplicem veritatem</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gregory de Valentia), in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligitur omnis rectitudo, &amp; immunitas à peccato in actionibus huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.

Now as by the <hi>intercurrency</hi> of other <hi>circumſtances,</hi> ſo eſpecially by <hi>occurrence</hi> of the <hi>ſcandall</hi> of weake brethren there may not be opportunity, and ſeaſonableneſſe of doing what we are urged unto by ſome affirmative precepts; and ſo thoſe precepts may <hi>pro his &amp; nunc</hi> ceaſe to be obligatory: For when the obligations of two precepts ſeeme to meete together at the very ſame time, that which is of greater obligation tieth us, and ſo conſequently we are for the preſent freed from the obligation of the other. Now the <hi>negative precept</hi> of eſchewing the ſcandall of the weake is more <hi>obligatory</hi> than many affirmative precepts; and therefore (to uſe the words of <hi>Malderus,</hi>) <hi>contingit aliquando praeceptum naturale affirmativum, hic &amp; nunc non obligare, propter concurſum negativi praecepti naturalis de vitando ſcandalo puſillorum:</hi> For example, vindicative juſtice binds a magiſtrate to execute wrath upon him that doth evill: Charity on the other ſide obligeth him to hinder, as much as he can, the ſcandall of the weake: now Charity is a virtue, of an higher note and nature, than vindicative juſtice: the precept belonging unto charity (hinder as much as you can the ſcandall of the weake) doth more ſtrictly tie us, than that pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto vindicative juſtice, (puniſh the guilty). And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it be probable, that a great and ſpreading ſcandall will be taken at the puniſhing of delinquents: a Magiſtrate may not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102374:56"/>tranſgreſſe againſt juſtice, and yet deferre the execution thereof.</p>
                  <p>But ſo manifold and different are the degrees of obligation in affirmative precepts: ſuch is the variety of circumſtances apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto the matters commanded by thoſe precepts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of alterations about thoſe circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, as that I do not ſee, how any unvariable rules, or conſtant directions can be given for Chriſtian carriage in this caſe. For particulars then, every man is to be left unto the guidance of his <hi>ſpirituall prudence</hi> and <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> which is to direct him in a right apprehenſion, and diſcretion of circumſtances: to define the opportunity, and ſeaſonableneſſe of practiſing what is commanded by affirmative precepts: and to compare them and the precept of eſchewing the ſcandall of the weake together: and thereupon to determine, which is <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> moſt <hi>obligatory,</hi> or doth moſt ſtrictly tye us to the obedience of it, as being of greater moment. Only in the generall wee may ſafely ſay thus much: that whereas wee have ſaid, that for ſhunning the ſcandall of the weake, we may forbeare the practiſe of things commanded by affirmative precepts, <hi>Hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in ſome places, and at ſome times, it muſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be taken with this proviſo, that there be not incurred a <hi>greater,</hi> and more <hi>perilous ſcandall,</hi> by <hi>forbearance,</hi> then would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be <hi>occaſioned</hi> by <hi>practiſe</hi> of <hi>the thing commanded;</hi> which is done, when either <hi>firſt, more</hi> are <hi>ſcandalized</hi> by the <hi>forbearance,</hi> than in all likely-hood would be at the <hi>practiſe:</hi> or elſe, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> when the <hi>body</hi> in generall, the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common wealth,</hi> or the greateſt, and cheifeſt part of either is <hi>ſcandalized</hi> at the forbeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and onely ſome <hi>few particular private perſons ſtumble</hi> at the <hi>practiſe:</hi> or elſe, <hi>thirdly,</hi> when others take occaſion by this <hi>partiall</hi> and <hi>temporary</hi> forbearance of what is commanded by <hi>affirmative precepts,</hi> to contemne the <hi>precepts themſelves,</hi> as being by this our carriage induced to beleive that we verily <hi>deſpiſe them,</hi> and do not ſo much, <hi>for a while forbeare,</hi> as utterly <hi>diſclaime</hi> the practiſe of what they command.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, that, according to the common opinion of the ſchoolemen, things commanded may in caſe of ſcandall for a while be omitted or forborne; but <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Becanus</hi> diſſent from them in this particular: the explication and confirmation of their opinion I will propound, and then breifely paſſe my cenſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <hi>Becanus,</hi> to make way for his opinion premiſeth, that there is a <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>naturall precepts,</hi> for <hi>ſome</hi> ſaith he bind <hi>ſimply,</hi> and alwaies whatſoever circumſtances intervene, and their obligation never ceaſeth, ſuch like are thoſe that forbid lying, perjury, hatred of God, Idolatry &amp;c: for theſe facts are ſo intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally ſinfull, as that they cannot by any circumſtances be made lawfull: <hi>others now</hi> bind not <hi>ſimply,</hi> and abſolutely, but with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circumſtances, and therefore they bind as long as thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances remaine, they ceaſe to bind when thoſe circumſtances are changed: Such is the precept for bidding to kill: for that binds with theſe circumſtances, that we kill not by our private autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, except in caſe of neceſſary defence. Take away theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and it binds not, for it is lawfull to kill upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of authority, or in our neceſſary defence: ſuch alſo is the precept of eſchewing ſcandall: for, however it be dictated by the law of nature, yet it obligeth not <hi>abſolutè &amp; quomodocunque:</hi> but with <hi>certaine circumſtances:</hi> and one circumſtance neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make it bind us is, that there occurre not any other precept, either naturall, or poſitive. The reaſon is, becauſe every one is bound to have a greater care of his own, than others ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently, rather to avoid ſin in himſelfe, than to prevent it in his brethren. And therefore that precept which is given us for the prevention of ſin in others, is but of a <hi>ſecondary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</hi> Now the precept of eſchewing ſcandall is impoſed, onely for the hindring of ſin in others, and therefore doth not tie us, when there occurreth any other precept, which is given for the avoiding of ſinne in our ſelves. But it may be objected, that the precept of ſhunning ſcandall is of the <hi>Law of nature,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more obligatory than thoſe precepts that are but <hi>poſitive.</hi> Unto this <hi>Becanus</hi> anſwereth, that a naturall precept is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, than that which is poſitive, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> that is, if each precept, both that which is naturall, and that which is poſitive, <hi>be primarily reſerred unto the</hi> furthering of our <hi>own</hi> ſalvation, unto the preventing of ſin in <hi>our ſelves:</hi> But now if on the other ſide the <hi>primary ſcope</hi> of the naturall precept be to hinder ſin in others, as it is in the precept of ſcandall; and the <hi>principall end</hi> of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive precept be to ſhun ſin in our ſelves, then that precept which is poſitive doth more deeply bind us, than that which is naturall.</p>

                  <p>Againe, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it may be objected: that if the obligation of the naturall precept of eſchewing ſcandall ceaſeth upon occurrence of but a poſitive precept; why, then it ſeems, this poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept detracts or derogates from the naturall precept of avoiding ſcandall: as being of greater force, and validity? In no wiſe, onely it takes away a circumſtance requiſite to make the precept of avoiding ſcandall obligatory, <hi>quare cum dicimus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vaſquez</hi>) <hi>non eſſe omittendum praeceptum poſitivum propter vitandum ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum proximi, non dicimus praeceptum naturale derogari pracepto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitivo tanquam fortiori; ſed dicimus occurſu praecepti poſitivi ceſſare quandam circumſtantiam neceſſariam, ut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But all this labour would have been ſaved, if the queſtion had been rightly ſtated: for, whereas it is ſaid, that one circumſtance neceſſarily requiſite to make the precept of eſchewing ſcandall bind us, is, that there occurre not any other precept either naturall or poſitive: this is to be underſtood <hi>cum grano ſalis,</hi> with this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in caſe ſuch precepts bind (all circumſtances conſidered to the performance of what they enjoyne) <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> at ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time and place; for then omiſſion of what they enjoine would be ſinfull, and we are not ſinfully to omit any thing, for prevention of ſcandall in our brother: Unto the proofe of which the reaſon of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it may be thought that I have ſtaied too long upon this digreſſion: to returne therefore where we left.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102374:58"/>to be, be but indifferent: why then, the beſt direction that we can have will be from what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writes unto the <hi>Romans chap.</hi> 14. and <hi>unto the Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>and chap.</hi> 10. of converts amongſt the Romans there were ſome ſtrong, and knowing ones, that were well principled, and ſo knew very well their deliverance from the yoake of the moſaicall Law: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, without any ſcruple, did eat ſuch meats as were prohibited thereby, perhaps Swines fleſh, or the like: Now at this their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, ſeverall weak Chriſtians, who were as yet ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtructed touching the latitude of their Chriſtian liberty, were in ſeverall regards ſcandalized, as I have ſhewen in a foregoing treatiſe: But yet here the practiſe of the ſtrong was a thing indifferent in it ſelfe <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.20. and the appearance of evill (to wit, a prophane, and irreligious contempt of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) was only imaginary, ariſing from the ignorance, and errour of the weak, who thought that Law of Moſes to be ſtill in force, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abrogated; and the ſcandall conſequent hereupon was <hi>only p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r accidens,</hi> flowing not from the nature of the action in it ſelfe, but from the miſapprehenſion of the weake: and yet the Apoſtle blames the ſtrong for ſcandalizing the weake: and therefore in this their action, though indifferent in it ſelfe, there was an active ſcandall, a ſcandall culpably given, as well as taken. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives the ſame reſolution unto the <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning things offered unto Idols; to eat them at the Pagan religious feaſt, and in the temple of an Idoll, carrieth a reall appearance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and approbation of an Idolatrous worſhip of the Idoll, and ſo is ſcandalous <hi>per ſe,</hi> of it ſelfe, and in its own nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20,21. But now to eat theſe ſame meats when ſold, and bought in the ſhambles, or ſet before them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings, the Apoſtle reſolves to be a thing lawfull, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27. And indeed it could not carry a reall, but only an imaginary appearance of evill; for they were the good creatures of God, and ſo uncapable of any morall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and they had no religious uſe, and ſo did not reflect any glance of the leaſt honour, credit, or countenance to the Idoll. The ſcandall then, accrewing by them, was only <hi>per accidens;</hi> and yet they were by the Apoſtles adviſe to be forborne, if ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall were likely to enſue upon the uſe of them. <hi>But if any wan
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102374:58"/>ſay unto thee, this is offered in ſacrifice unto Idols, eat not for his ſake that ſhewed it, and for conſcience ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.28. Here we have a <hi>generall rule,</hi> together with <hi>three limitations</hi> thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> a generall <hi>rule:</hi> if any man imagine evill, and ſin to be in an indifferent action, and hereupon be ſcandalized, that action is to be abſtained from; <hi>if any man ſay unto thee, this is offered in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto Idols, eat not, for his ſake that ſhewed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now here are couched three <hi>exceptions.</hi>

And indeed, if we are to forbeare all indifferent things, in which there is only a meer poſſibility of ſcandall, we ſhould be at an utter loſſe, and uncertainty in our actings in things indifferent, and never know what to doe, we are obliged then to abſtain from things indifferent, only in the caſe of

                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond</hi> exception is; that we are not required to abſtaine from things indifferent, in which our weake brethren imagine that there is evill and ſin, and thereupon are ſcandalized, unleſſe they have ſome probable ground for their imagination: for though the eating of the Idolothytes at a private feaſt was not an action in it ſelfe ſcandalous, or <hi>inductive</hi> unto ſin; as being free from both ſin, and all reall appearance of it, yet the Corinthians ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized hereat had a probable ground why they conceived it to be unlawfull and ſinfull, the late <hi>morall or religious relation</hi> that the Idolothytes had unto an Idoll: <hi>this is offered in ſacrifice unto Idols; Mr Rutherford</hi> [in his treatiſe of ſcandall pag. 53, 54.] expreſſeth this limitation as followeth; <hi>we read not of ſcandals cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in Gods word, but there be ſome morall reaſons in them;</hi> and he apply eth it unto the offence, that is taken, at tolling of bells, at a miniſters gowne, when he preacheth: there is no apparent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon why the tolling of a Bell, or a miniſters gowne ſhould ſcandalize; for they are of meere civill uſe, and have no morall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102374:59"/>influence in the worſhip; for the ſame tolling of bells is, and may be uſed to convocate the people to a Baron Court to heare a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, to convocate ſouldiers. This exception, that I have lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe, is, I conceive, grounded, as upon what the Apoſtle ſaith; ſo alſo upon the reality, and truth of our Chriſtian liberty in things indifferent, which otherwiſe would ſignifie nothing; for if we are to abſtaine from all indifferent things, in which another without probable ground imagineth that there is ſin; the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſtians under the Goſpell would be farre greater, and more intolerable, then that of the Iewes under the moſaicall adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>third exception;</hi> which we may gather hence, is, in great part, coincident with the firſt, and 'tis; that the abſtinence unto which we are obliged, in things indifferent, in the caſe of ſcandall, is not <hi>univerſall, and totall,</hi> but limited <hi>ad hic &amp; nunc,</hi> thoſe times, and places in which there is danger, or likelyhood of ſcandall: the Corinthians were, in their private feaſts, to forbeare eating Idolothytes, only in the preſence of perſons apt to be ſcandalized, and might elſewhere uſe their liberty without regret of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Unto theſe exceptions inſinuated here by the Apoſtle we may adde divers others, of which, ſome may be collected from what we above ſaid touching the ſcandall of the wicked in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> and by and by I ſhall adde others; but firſt I ſhall examine ſome reſtrictions, which I gave in a former edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this booke.</p>

                        <hi>But now, if the action in which this appearance of evill is ſuppoſed to be, be but indifferent, then theſe two following things muſt be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.

                        <hi>If it be annexed to a neceſſary duty, we muſt not omit this, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from that: So to fly the ſhadow of ſin, we ſhould embrace the body of ſin, a ſinne really ſo, a ſinne of omiſſion; for what is not good, if to omit a duty be not bad? Good muſt not be left undone, though evill</hi> per accidens <hi>come from it, much leſſe, when only an appearance of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102374:59"/>evill is joined to it. We muſt not then ſhun the Lords table, becauſe ſome weaker judgments have imagined in the act of kneeling, a ſhew of Idolatry. So to avoid but an imaginary appearance of evill unto men, we ſhall appeare indeed unto God to be evill.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>circumſtantiall,</hi> ſuch are the Circumſtances of time or place, matters of order, decency, and the like. Now theſe are neceſſary in the <hi>generall,</hi> and the <hi>particulars</hi> may be determined by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, or Church-officers v. g. that the publique aſſemblies be at ſuch a convenient time of the day, in ſuch a place, and that they be convocated by tolling of bells; that the Miniſter officiate in a grave habit, gowne, cloake, or coate, &amp;c. Now though ſome of theſe may be by ſome cauſeleſly imagined to be evill; yet they are not therefore to be forborne, if they be by lawfull command of the Magiſtrate, or Church, to be annexed with neceſſary duties; for neceſſary duties are not to be omitted for meere circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces connexed with their performance.</p>
                     <p>Thus we are not to forſake, or refraine our publick aſſemblies, becauſe ſome think there is ſome ſuperſtition in the places of them, our Churches, and the Convocation of them by bells, upon this ground, that both our Churches and bells have been abuſed by Papiſts. Dr <hi>Heylin</hi> [in a former edition of his Geography] relates this following ſtory of <hi>Peter Du Moulin;</hi> that hearing how diverſe Engliſh Miniſters ſcrupled to officiate in a Surplice, he ſaid, that he would willingly preach at <hi>Paris</hi> in a fooles coate, if leave could not be gotten of the King, upon any other condition. If this great light of France ever dropped ſuch words, he had in them doubtleſſe a very good, devout, and zealous meaning; but yet (under correction) I cannot ſee how his reſolution can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with that rule of the Apoſtle; <hi>Let all things be done decently;</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:102374:60"/>for it cannot as yet ſink into my fooliſh head, how that a fooles coat is a decent garment to preach in. But this on the bie.</p>
                     <p>To proceed unto a <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> of Ceremonies, which we may call, for diſtinction ſake, <hi>humane, Doctrinall, Ceremonies;</hi> ſuch as men inſtitute, by their morall ſignification, to teach, v.g. the Croſſe, Surplice &amp;c: if theſe might lawfully, by any humane authority whatſoever, be unavoidably annexed with neceſſary duties, we ſhould then ſoon reſolve, that we are not then to abſtaine from them; but the non-conformiſts ever held that no mortall wight whatſoever could lawfully urge, or preſſe the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of ſuch Ceremonies with neceſſary duties: and indeed they have very good reaſon againſt the Command of ſuch a connexion; becauſe it would have been againſt <hi>religion, and againſt charity.</hi>

The Prelates connexing of humane ſymbolicall ceremonies with duties and ordinances that are neceſſary, and commanded by the word of God, brings into my mind an artifice of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: <hi>in the market places of Cities, he ſet up his own image, with the Effigies of the gods of the Heathen pictured round about, to the end, that whoſoever ſhould do civill reverence to the Emperours Image, might alſo ſeem to worſhip the gods of the Gentiles: and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they who would not bow to the Gods of the Gentiles, might ſeeme alſo to refuſe all due reverence to the Emperour.</hi> — Thus the Prelates, of their own heads, moſt preſumptuouſly have ſet up in Gods worſhip, and ſervice, their own inventions, and have commanded them to be joined with the ordinances of Chriſt: ſo that hereby they drave many conſcientious Miniſters into a great ſtrait, if, out of a lothneſſe to looſe the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto their Ceremonies, this they interpreted to be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation

When the Obligation of two precepts ſeemingly lyeth upon us at the ſame time, and impoſſible for both to be at once obeyed, in ſuch a caſe, becauſe there is no claſhing between Gods precepts, neither doth God by them impoſe upon his creatures any neceſſity of ſinning, therefore one of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts muſt give place unto the other; to wit, that which enjoyneth a</hi> leſſe <hi>duty, unto that which preſcribes a more weighty and</hi> preſſing one. <hi>Now the duties of Juſtice</hi> (<hi>as a learned Inconformitant, even</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſius <hi>himſelfe, med: Theol. lib.</hi> 2. cap. 16. §. 62, 63, <hi>will tell us</hi>) <hi>are of ſtricter obligation then thoſe of charity.

Now to hinder the ſcandall of the weake, is a duty of Charity; to obey the lawfull commands of authority, a duty of juſtice; and therefore of the greater obligation and moment, unto it then the other muſt give place. I would have travelled farther in this argument, but that I am anticipated by the learned, and reverend Profeſſors of Aberdene in their Duplies to the ſecond anſwers of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting miniſters, who from</hi> pag. 65. <hi>unto</hi> 75. <hi>have purpoſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed this very queſtion, whether the precept of obedience to Superiors, or the precept of eſchewing ſcandall be more obligatory, and have there proved by many unanſwerable arguments, that the former precept, that of obedience to Superiours is of the twaine more Obligatory.

Nay if in ſome caſe, the Law cannot poſſibly be obſerved, but ſome great damage, ſcandall, or inconvenience, muſt needs follow, it is to be preſumed, that the Law-giver never intended that the Law in ſuch a caſe ſhould be obſerved. We would reckon him a very cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Magiſtrate that ſhould be implacably angry at a ſicke man for eating fleſh in a time of Lent, and can we thinke then, that there was any ſuch thing as Chriſtian pity and commiſeration in the breaſts of thoſe men whom nothing could attone for the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Croſſe, Surplice, &amp;c? while they ſcandalized, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the immortall ſoules of many for whome Chriſt dyed.

Nay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we imagine his Maſter to be a moſt bloudy Tyrant, we muſt needs think, that he will be highly diſpleaſed at ſo horrid a cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and can any man then make any tolerable apology for the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of our late Prelates, who commanded all to drive on with a furious career in the courſe of conformity, without any the leaſt ſtop, though hereby were hazarded a world of ſoules, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at no lower a rate than the divine bloud of our bleſſed Saviour?</p>
                     <p>It is the will and pleaſure of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> that matters commanded by his <hi>affirmative precepts</hi> ſhould be, for a while, forborne, in caſe of the <hi>likelihood</hi> of <hi>ſcandall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;</hi> but theſe men (in imitation of him that exalted himſelfe above all that is <hi>called God</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4.) could not be perſwaded

                     <p>But now the non-conformiſts might ſpare all this diſcourſe touching the obligation of humane lawes in generall: becauſe they hold that <hi>humane, religious, Doctrinall Ceremonies</hi> the matter in queſtion, cannot be lawfully determined by the authority of either Politicall, or Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiours: and for this they have <hi>two,</hi> as I take it, very <hi>convincing arguments.</hi>

                     <p>From this reſolution the unlawfulneſſe of the injunction of ſuch ceremonies as ours will undeniably follow.</p>
                     <p>To cleare this I ſhall <hi>preſuppoſe</hi> that, which cannot (with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon) be denied: to wit, that, that, which <hi>Paul</hi> held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102374:63"/>for himſelfe to practiſe in his own perſon upon a generall account belonging to all Chriſtians, could not by him be lawfully impoſed upon others by an Eccleſiaſticall Canon; but now <hi>Paul</hi> held it unlawfull to eat fleſh in caſe of ſcandall probably conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and this was upon a generall reaſon belonging to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and therefore he thought it utterly unlawfull to impoſe any ſuch matter upon others when ſcandall was likely to follow.</p>
                     <p>From this thus premiſed, I ſhall hence thus argue <hi>Syllogiſtically,</hi> againſt our Prelates impoſition of our Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>If it were unlawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to impoſe upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſuch ceremonies as ours, then it was unlawfull for our Prelates to impoſe ſuch upon us.</p>
                     <p>But it was unlawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to impoſe ſuch Ceremonies as ours upon the Corinthians.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it was unlawfull for the Prelates to impoſe ſuch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies upon us.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſequele</hi> of the <hi>major</hi> is evident: becauſe the Prelates could not pretend unto ſo much authority in matters Eccleſiaſticall as <hi>Paul</hi> had: for in each of the Apoſtles there was a greater <hi>fulneſſe of juriſdiction</hi> then in any that ſucceeded them.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Minor</hi> that may be confirmed by this following Syllogiſme.</p>
                     <p>If it were unlawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to impoſe upon the Corinthians the eating of fleſh when ſcandall was likely to enſue, then it was unlawfull for him to impoſe upon them the uſe of ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as ours.</p>
                     <p>But the former appeareth to be unlawfull by the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the latter was unlawfull alſo.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing here can be queſtioned but the <hi>Major,</hi> and that is eaſily confirmed from a juſt <hi>compariſon</hi> of <hi>fleſh with ſuch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as ours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> the eating of fleſh was undoubtedly a thing more cleerly indifferent, then the practiſe of ſuch Ceremonies of ours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> fleſh was neceſſary unto the maintenance of the life of man by <hi>diſjunction:</hi> that is, fleſh, or ſome other meat: but now ſuch Ceremonies as ours are not neceſſary unto the worſhip and ſervice of God by <hi>diſjunction:</hi> for God may be worſhipped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, or any others in their ſtead: a ſurplice (ſaith <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102374:64"/>is not neceſſary by way of diſjunction, for neither is ſurplice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, nor any other white or red habit, that hath ſome myſticall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, like unto Surplice: So kneeling to the elements is neither neceſſary, nor any the like religious honouring of them by proſtration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, or kiſſing them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But againſt this accuſation of our Ceremonies for ſcandall there are objected <hi>two Compariſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, of the duties of juſtice and Charity together:</hi> the duties of juſtice are more obligatory then the duties of charity, as being not only a <hi>morall, but a legall debt:</hi> Now to hinder the ſcandall of the weak is a duty of charity, <hi>only a morall debt,</hi> to obey the lawfull command of authority in things indifferent a <hi>duty of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, a legall debt;</hi> and therefore of the greater obligation, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſhall the rather inſiſt on this argument, becauſe it is of late ſo much ſtood on by Dr <hi>Sanderſon</hi> [in his laſt Sermons prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1656. pag. 249.] <hi>where we are not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>able to diſcharge both: debts of juſtice are to be paid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before bebts of charity. Now the duty of obedience is</hi> debitum juſtitiae, <hi>and a matter of right: my ſuperiour may challenge it at my hands as his due; and I doe him</hi> wrong, <hi>if I withhold it from him. But the care of not giving offence is but</hi> debitum charitatis, <hi>and a matter of but</hi> courteſie. <hi>I am to performe it to my brother in love, when I ſee cauſe: but he cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it from me as his right, nor can juſtly ſay I do him wrong, if I neglect it. It is therefore no more lawfull for me to diſobey the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full command of a ſuperiour, to prevent thereby the offence of one or a few brethren, then it is lawfull for me to do one man wrong, to do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man a courteſie withall, or then it is lawfull for me to rob the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer to relieve an Hoſpitall.</hi>

                     <p>

But it is not to a purpoſe for the Doctors: for all offices and duties generally, and univerſally, of what ever kind, which we owe by may of Juſtice, are not more obligatory, than duties which we owe only by way of charity: as when duties of a poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, enjoined by our ſuperiours, and duties which we owe by charity only, are compared to ether, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore in ſome caſes when our ſuperiours commandements are only poſitive Lawes, they are not more obligatory, than duties of Charity, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded in the Law of nature.

                     <p>This diſpute of ſcandall is annexed unto his divine right of Church Government, which was publiſhed 1646. ſince that Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> 1656 (as I ſhewed you but now) propounds the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument a new, with a great deale of triumph, but without any conſiderable reinforcement; and withall he takes no notice of <hi>Rutherford,</hi> his anſwer, from whence I gather that he never read it: and indeed it is a thing very incident unto the greateſt Schollars of that party to cenſure, but never to reade their adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to ſay ſomething unto Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> as well as unto the Duplyers, I muſt needs confeſſe, that I am tranſported with a juſt admiration, that ſo great a ſchollar ſhould ſo extenuate, as he doth, the guilt of an active ſcandall; for he makes the care of not giving offence to a brother to be a matter but of courteſy; he cannot, (ſaith he) juſtly ſay I do him wrong, if I neglect it: But <hi>firſt,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes another language, in his account to make <hi>brethren to offend is to ſin againſt them, to wound their weake conſciences, and ſo to ſin againſt Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 8.12.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102374:66"/>Compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 11.13. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15.20. he reſolves, that 'tis a <hi>deſtroying of a brother</hi> for whom Chriſt died, a <hi>deſtroying of the worke of God in him:</hi> whereupon Divines generally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that 'tis ſoule-murther: Now, in wounding the weake conſcience of our brother, in murthering his immortall ſoule, there is doubtleſſe ſome wrong committed againſt him: not to deſtroy him for whom Chriſt dyed &amp;c. is more than a matter of meer courteſy unto him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuppoſe the care of not giving offence be, in reſpect of our brother, but <hi>debitum charitatis;</hi> yet in regard of God 'tis <hi>debitum juſtitiae,</hi> a legall debt: he may, and doth challenge it as due, and we do him wrong if we diſobey him.

                        <hi>Firſt;</hi> if the Compariſon be on both ſides to be underſtood of ſcandall taken in a <hi>ſecondary ſenſe,</hi> there is no doubt, but the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the Magiſtrate is more dangerous, than that of one, who is only a brother: for the wrath of the ſupreame Magiſtrate is <hi>as the Meſſengers of death, Prov.</hi> 16.14. <hi>as the roaring of a Lyon, Prov.</hi> 19.12. In indifferent things then it will be our ſafeſt courſe to anger a brother, rather then to diſpleaſe the Magiſtrate. But this acception of ſcandall is impertinent unto our purpoſe, and ſo much is confeſſed by Dr <hi>Hammond</hi> in his treatiſe of ſcandall <hi>pag:</hi> 23. <hi>To be angry, grieved, troubled, at any action of another, is not (to be offended) in the ſcripture ſenſe, nor conſequently doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that I have done a miſſe in doing that which another man is angry at, unleſſe my action be in it ſelfe evill.</hi> The ſcandall we ſpeak of is culpable; but to diſpleaſe a magiſtrate is not alwaies a ſin: the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of ſcandall for the angring of one is taken notice of by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> alſo upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. having affirmed, that ſome corrupted the doctrine of ſcandall with fooliſh gloſſes, and others with their impious calumnies, he ſheweth the originall of both their miſtakes touching the meaning of offence in the Apoſtle. <hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the compariſon be to be underſtood of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the Magiſtrate in a <hi>primary acception</hi> with a ſcandall of a brother in a <hi>primary acception</hi> too: then I ſhould thinke, that the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102374:67"/>ſcandall of the Magiſtrate is the greater, and more to be eſchewed, it is a greater ſin culpably to occaſion the fall of the Magiſtrate into ſin, then the fall of a meere brother: becauſe the falls of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are of a more pernicious example, giving greater counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and encouragement unto ſin.</p>
                     <p>But this will no wayes advantage our Sticklers for Ceremonies: for the non-conformiſts deny, that their forbearance of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did culpably occaſion the fall of the Magiſtrate into ſinne: and the contrary they expect to have proved and not barely dictated.</p>
                     <p>One thing let me obſerve on the bie, before I paſſe on: and 'tis: that, if thoſe who make this compariſon of the ſcandall of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate with the ſcandall of a brother, take ſcandall on both ſides in the primary acception thereof: then they ſeeme to intimate, that there may be a caſe wherein a man may be neceſſitated cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably to occaſion the fall, either of a Magiſtrate, or of a brother into ſinne: Of a Magiſtrate if he forbeare what he commands, of a brother if he practiſe it: But this is not <hi>caſus dabilis,</hi> for God by his providence, can never neceſſitate a man unto ſin: of this <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> ſpeaks very ſolidly in his refutation of the Dupliers <hi>pag.</hi> 41, 42. <hi>You ſhall</hi> (ſaith he unto them) <hi>be forced to give a caſe, wherein we are neceſſitated by Gods providence, and that by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, whether we forbeare, or forbeare not to murther either the ſoules of ſome weake ones, or the ſoules of ſuperiours, by our forbearance of the practiſe of things judged expedient by ſuperiours: You make us to murther the ſoules of Superiours, by the non-forbearance, or you will have us to murther the ſoules of weake brethren, if we practiſe. This is a wronging of providence, and a Manichean tenent, that we can be under ſuch a neceſſity of ſinning. Yea, there muſt be two contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Wills in God, Commanding, by forbearing the Ceremonies, not to murther Superiours, and commanding by not forbearing, not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weake brethren: and ſo God commandeth both to forbeare and alſo not to forbeare.</hi> Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> [in his treatiſe of ſcandalizing <hi>p.</hi> 266, 267, 268.] quarrels with <hi>Ames,</hi> for affirming, that there can be no ſuch perplexity, that it ſhould be neceſſary for a Godly man, whether he do this or that, or not do it, to ſcandalize ſome one: But Dr <hi>Ames</hi> is to be underſtood of a ſcandall in the <hi>primary ſenſe,</hi> a cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable occaſioning the fall of another into ſin: and the objections of Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> proceed only concerning ſcandall in a <hi>ſecundary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:102374:68"/>thereof, as will be apparent unto any one, that will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to peruſe them.</p>
                     <p>There be <hi>two things</hi> more I ſhall take notice of in my foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſuppoſe all along that the Convocation was our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Church of England: but ſurely ſhe was a ſtep mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto divers of the Godly, uſing towards them farre more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, then unto ſuch whom profaneſſe rendered obnoxious unto their Courts: if any indifferent man looke upon their Canons he muſt needs confeſſe, that one of their cheife deſignes was to cruſh, and perſecute ſuch religious perſons, whom they nicknamed Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, to <hi>deſtroy</hi> with their Ceremonies ſuch among them for whom Chriſt died. But I wonder upon what account, I, or any man elſe, could think it to be the Church of England. If in any ſenſe it can be called the Church of England, it was becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Miniſtry of England, and that it did not; becauſe the farre major part of it were <hi>Cathedrall men, Biſhops, Deanes. Arch-Deacons,</hi> and ſuch as were choſen by the reſpective <hi>Chapters</hi> of each Cathedrall: it might then be a repreſentation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Miniſters, but not of the miniſtry of England: and that I ſhall make good by two <hi>parallels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt</hi> ſhall be, betwixt our Convocations, and the Councill of Trent: many ſober, and moderate Papiſts accuſed this to be a pack'd aſſembly, a repreſentation, of, not the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> but the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> becauſe the greateſt part of it were of the Popes faction, and depended wholy upon him: So the Major part of our Convocations were of the Biſhops faction, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chiefly the intereſts of Cathedrals: and therefore were not a repreſentative of all the Miniſters in England. I ſhall exemplifie this by inſtancing in the <hi>Dioceſſe</hi> of <hi>Bathe,</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> wherein I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: In this there were members of the lower houſe of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, one Deane, three Archdeacons, and one choſen by the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wells: and to ballance theſe there were but two Clarkes choſen by the Miniſtry of the whole <hi>Dioceſſe:</hi> Now what impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall man, but will determine that theſe ſeaven could be no due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Miniſters of the <hi>Dioceſſe</hi> of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> as long as five of them were members of the Cathedrall, in whoſe election the Miniſters of the Dioceſſe had no hand at all.</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102374:68"/>
                     <p>A <hi>ſecond paralell</hi> ſhall be betwixt our convocation, and a civill aſſembly: wherein we will ſuppoſe, that the Prince chooſeth <hi>three hundred,</hi> who are his Courtiers, or elſe ſuch as have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, either wholy, or in great part upon him: and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chooſe only a <hi>hundred:</hi> you may call this aſſembly a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or what you will; but ſurely no rationall man can thinke it to be a repreſentation of the nation: and as irrationall were it to call the Convocation a repreſentation of the Miniſters, of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſeeing thoſe choſen by the Miniſters were an inconſiderable part of the Convocation.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>unto this we may adde;</hi> that there was ſeldome a due, and regular choice made of the Clerks of the Convocation: I was preſent at the laſt election, that was at Wells: and then <hi>Biſhop P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>And when yet, by all this violence, he was unlikely to carry it for ſuch as he had nominated; why then, he had another ſhift, that was (I believe) never heard of before: he enabled the Pluraliſts, of whom either all, or moſt were his favorites, to voice it in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall capacities: to give as many double voices, as they had dignities, and benefices: his Son gave at that time eight ſingle voices, two as he was Archdeacon of Bath, two as he was Prebend of Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, two as he was Parſon of Bucklan-Mary, two as he was Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Kingsbury: Now, to ſay that ſuch an election was regular, and lawfull is as ridiculous, and ſenſeleſſe, as if a man ſhould ſay, that in the Choice of Knights of the Shire for Parliament; men may give as many double voices, as they have Farmes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>ſecond thing</hi> I ſhall take notice of, in the now mentioned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, is my miſinterpretation of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. Upon which I thus deſcanted: <hi>as</hi> Paul <hi>exhorts to give none offence neither to Jew nor Gentile, ſo he addes in a further ſpecialty nor to the Church of God:</hi> The Jewes and Gentiles were but <hi>parts,</hi> the Church of God the <hi>whole,</hi> they but <hi>brethren,</hi> ſhe the <hi>mother.</hi> Here <hi>was a groſſe miſtake,</hi> in thinking, that the Jewes and Gentiles here ſpoken of were <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the</hi> Church: whereas, by the Apoſtles diſtinction of them
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102374:69"/>from the Church of God, it is plaine, that they were not as yet converted unto the Chriſtian faith, but were as yet enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and conſequently ſtrangers unto the Church: And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finiſhed my examination of the two limitations that I gave in a former edition of this treatiſe. I ſhall goe on to that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the action in which this appearance of evill is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined to be as indifferent in it felfe, ſo alſo not annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a neceſſary duty, and we alſo left to the uſe of our liberty, what then?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Two-things</hi> are here eſpecially to be conſidered: <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>quality</hi> of the action excepted at; <hi>ſecondly, the difference of times, and places.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To beginne with <hi>the firſt,</hi> the action (at which thy brother is ſcandalized, by his groundleſſe imagination, that 'tis evill, or carrieth a reall appearance of evill) <hi>is</hi> either of <hi>none, or great importance to thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it <hi>be of none importance,</hi> but weightleſſe, as affording thee either none, or but ſmall benefit: offend not thy brother by an unſeaſonable exerciſe of thy liberty.

                     <p>After <hi>Cajetan, Petrus de Lorica</hi> doth roundly and fully expreſſe the matter. <hi>Verum eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quod Cajetanus advertit, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum puſillorum perſeverare poſſe adhuc, poſtquam reddita eſt ratio facti, vel quia rationem non capiunt ob mentis tarditatem, vel ob con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudinem diu firmatam: in quo caſu docet Cajetanus omittendam eſſe actionem, ex quâ ſcandalum accipiunt; vel differendam, donec ad ſaniorem mentem venerint.

                     <p>Having laid downe a rule, that for avoiding the ſcandall of our neighbour, which ſpringeth, either from his ignorance, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it behooveth us by the obligation of Charity, to do, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that which may be done, or left undone without ſin: he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards puts this exception. <hi>Eſt autem animadvertendum hanc re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam intelligi debere de omni eo, quod ſine peccato fieri, aut omitti poſſit, non quom docunque, ſed moralitèr, attentâ ſuavitate, quae eſt in jugo legum divinarum: id eſt, quod ſine peccato fieri, aut omitti poſſit, ſine maxima etiam aliqua, &amp; penè intolerabili difficultate, ſpectata quoque in hac conditione perſonae &amp;c,</hi> And indeed (me thinks) he ſpeaks reaſonably. For improbable ſeems it, that the ſweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which is in the yoake of divine lawes, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with ſo great a rigour, as in all matters whatſoever, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unlawfull, to exact, not only a brotherly, but alſo a ſervile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliancy with every ſuppoſed weak one, whoſe weakneſſe may be but pretended by thoſe, that are willing to ſpeake favourably of them. For the humouring and contenting of every ſuppoſed weakling in all matters at which he takes offence, I conceive not my ſelfe bound to endanger my life, to hazard my eſtate, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or to incurre any other great, or notable inconvenience: for that would truly be <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> an hard ſaying: who were able to beare it?</p>
                     <p>But now againſt this <hi>may be objected</hi> the reſolution of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to offend:</hi> fleſh is of great expediency for the nouriſhment of mans life, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> reſolves upon a perpetuall abſtinence therefrom in caſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall Conſequent; and this example of <hi>Paul</hi> is obligatory unto all Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>anſwer, firſt,</hi> this fleſh may be underſtood only of ſuch as was ſacrificed unto Idols; for words in ſcripture uſually are to be reſtrained unto the ſubject matter ſpoken of, and the meat, and fleſh, here ſpoken of in the Context, was ſuch as had been offered unto an Idoll.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly, Paul</hi> is to be underſtood, only upon ſuppoſition that the Goſpell ſhould not be fully promulgated, and brethren ſhould remain uninſtructed concerning the nature of Chriſtian Liberty; for uſually 'tis in this caſe only, that to eat fleſh involves in the guilt of an active ſcandall, makes a brother to offend: hence the Apoſtle exhorts the ſtrong amongſt <hi>the Romans</hi> to abſtaine from meats forbiden by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for prevention of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the weake: but amongſt the <hi>Galathians, and Coloſſians</hi> he diſlikes ſuch an abſtinence, and dehorts from it: &amp; the <hi>reaſon,</hi> of this his <hi>different carriage,</hi> was: becauſe the weak amonſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were not fully taught the doctrine of Chriſtian liberty, &amp; the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians &amp; Coloſſians were Julian,</hi> miſtaking the Apoſtles doctrine of ſcádall, thought to make uſe of it for the ſtarving of the Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102374:71"/>Idolatry, and ſuperſtition: he inſtanceth in Churches, abuſed unto the ſaying of Maſſe, and unto the Idolatrous worſhip of Saints, and in bells that have been abuſed by Papiſts by being conſecrated, baptized &amp; uſed to chaſe away divels: &amp; for this his determination you may gather out of him [p. 69, 70, 71, 72, 75, &amp;c.] <hi>theſe two reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe abſtinence from ſuch things, (upon a religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for avoidance of ſcandall, becauſe abuſed to Idolatry, and ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) would be, (after a full publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Goſpell) a Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing, an externall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity with the Jew, a betraying of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming &amp; hardning the Jewes in their Apoſtacy: it would make, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, Jeſus Chriſt of no effect, it would make us debters to Circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to all the Ceremonies of Moſes, <hi>Ga.</hi> 5.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the practiſe of ſuch things, ſince we are fully poſſeſſed in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, <hi>is morally</hi> and <hi>Theologically neceſſary,</hi> for the aſſerting of our Chriſtian liberty: to ſhew, that <hi>every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. That <hi>unto the pure all things are pure, Titus</hi> 1.15. that <hi>we dare not call that uncleane which God hath cleanſed,</hi> Act. 10.15.</p>
                     <p>But there is one paſſage in this authour concerning ſcandall, which I cannot in any waies approve of: it is pag. 58, 59. where he averreth, that things of meere civill uſe, that are neceſſary with a neceſſity of conveniency are to be forborne, if ſcandall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if they be not convenient in the higheſt degree. And that no man may think I miſreport him, take his own words. <hi>There be ſome things of meere civill uſe, as Bells, gownes, Pulpits, preaching on Tueſday or Thurſday. Theſe be conſidered two waies.</hi> 1. <hi>As ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary with neceſſity of conveniency ſimply.</hi> 2. <hi>With neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency ſecundum praevalentem gradum, as convenient in the higheſt degree of neceſſity, or that morall maximum quod ſic. In the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, what ſcandalizeth, is to be rejected: in the laſt reſpect they oblige, and if any be ſcandalized thereat, it is taken and not given.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſure this doctrine if embraced will put and hold mens Conſciences upon a perpetuall rack: <hi>For it will</hi> be a matter of great difficulty eſpecially for ſome men allwaies to determine what in their indifferencies is convenient in the higheſt degree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we muſt put a difference between times, and places: for however they be but circumſtances of actions, and therefore extrinſecall to them, ſo that they cannot cauſe any ſuch eſſentiall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102374:72"/>variation in them, as to make thoſe actions materially good, or ſinfull, which are of themſelves in their own nature indifferent: yet notwithſtanding the publick and ordinary abuſe of an action at ſuch a time, or in ſuch a place, may make it then and there, in that place and for that time appeare to be evill; although the ſame action at another time, and in the ſame place; or in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, at the ſame time, may not be obnoxious to any ſuch cenſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then, time may alter this <hi>imaginary appearance</hi> of evill in an action. Reſervation of the brazen ſerpent, as for other ends and purpoſes, ſo for commemoration of that miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Iſraelites thereby, from the ſtings of fiery Serpents, was for a while free from all ſuſpicion, either of Idolatry or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: but when once it became the generall, ordinary, nay daily occaſion, and object of Idolatry, of the groſſeſt, and moſt palpable kind of Idolatry that can be, when incenſe was offered to it: then if the publique Magiſtrate had not demoliſhed it, he might juſtly have been thought to favour that Idolatry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was polluted. And therefore commendable was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his zeale in breaking it in peices, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4.</p>
                     <p>In the former Edition it was obſerved out of <hi>Morton</hi> that the ſame <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not deſtroy the high places, which <hi>Solomon</hi> had built for <hi>Aſtoreth,</hi> the abomination of the Sidonians: and for <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> the abomination of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> and for <hi>Milchom,</hi> the abomination of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and yet was never taxed for countenancing of Idolatry. For in his daies the Idols there erected, were diſregarded no man worſhipping them, and therefore might ſafely be ſuffered to ſtand: but when afterwards they were generally and uſually adored, then the good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> juſtly demoliſhed them: and indeed ſhould he have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them then when the Idolatry wherewith they were defiled, was flagrant at the height, he might juſtly be ſuſpected to be a favourer of that Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>But unto this obſervation of <hi>Mortons, Ames</hi> thus replyeth. <hi>He propoundeth, as very obſervable, that Hezekiah did not aboliſh the Idols, which</hi> Solomon <hi>ſuffered to be ſet up, becauſe they were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. But.</hi> 1. <hi>it may well be thought that thoſe idols were deſtroyed by</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and ſet up again before the time of</hi> Joſiah, <hi>as many other
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102374:72"/>ſuperſtitions were.</hi> 2. <hi>It cannot be doubted but they ſhould have been deſtroyed, even though they were for the time neglected: becauſe either</hi> Hezekiah <hi>had as good cauſe to deſtroy them as Joſiah; or elſe he might have prevented that cauſe which</hi> Joſiah <hi>had: and to prevent evill, we are as well bound, as to correct it.</hi>

                        <hi>It was added by the Repl. that thoſe Idols ſhould have been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (though they had been for the time neglected) becauſe that evill for which Joſiah deſtroyed them, ought as well to have been prevented as corrected. To this the rejoinder anſwereth, that this is not true, except</hi> Hezekiah <hi>had ſuſpected that evill. And who will ſay, that there is no cauſe to ſuſpect evill of an Idoll, though it be for a time neglected? or can any man thinke, that if the Iſraelites had neglected them, no Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian, Moabite, or Ammonite gave occaſion of any evill to be ſuſpected by thoſe Idols? The Spaniſh and French Papiſts (to ſay nothing of Engliſh) when they in paſſing by the Croſſe in Cheape-ſide, do reverence unto it, give they not cauſe to ſuſpect ſome evill to cleave unto it? The ſame meanes (ſaith the Rejoinder) are not alwaies requiſite for prevention, which muſt be uſed for recovery. Yes truly, about
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102374:74"/>Idols (if we judge out of the Scripture) the very ſame meanes. Burne then</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Rejoinder</hi>) <hi>all your Popiſh books, leſt they fall into the hands of Popelings to abuſe them. So will I certainly, if you can ſhew me, that they muſt be burned, when Popelings have had them in their hands, and abuſed them, which here you grant concerning theſe Idols.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is nothing of the Rejoinder left unexamined, but his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.5. and how impertinently that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged will appeare by compariſon of it with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid did that, which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing, that be commanded him all the daies of his life, ſave onely in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah the Hittite.</hi> For from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>David</hi> we may as well conclude, that his numbering of the people, and his purpoſe and attempt to revenge himſelfe of <hi>Nabal</hi> by deſtroying him and all his, were lawfull; as we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre from the praiſes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that his omiſſion in not demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing <hi>Solomons</hi> outlandiſh Idols, muſt be unlawful: See <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> pag. 90.</p>

Indeed our Ceremonies, for example, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, Croſſe in Baptiſme, kneeling at the Lords Supper, may have a materiall ſemblance with thoſe that in Popery have been abuſed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ſuperſtition, and ſo conſequently taken materially, in reſpect of their materialls, may have an outward ſhew of Popiſh Idol. try, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; but conſider them as impoſed by our Church, and generally uſed by her members, ſo they are formally differ need from thoſe which Papiſts have applyed to Idolatrous ends and purpoſes. For our Church publickly profeſſeth a quite contrary uſe or application, end, or intention of them.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102374:75"/>though our Prelates diſavowed many, nay moſt of thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous ends, unto which the Papiſts applyed our Ceremonies, yet they ſtill profeſſed one end and intention of the Papiſts in the uſe of them, to wit, <hi>myſticall ſignification;</hi> and this to be a Popiſh and ſuperſtitious end, the non-conformiſts prove at large in their books.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, a materiall conformity</hi> in Ceremonies, carrieth many times a reall appearance of evill, and ſcandalizeth actively. It doth not appeare that the Altar which <hi>

                     <p>Some thinke that though a different end and intention from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Iewes, and Hereticks in the uſe of their Ceremonies, cannot legitimate them and free them from ſcandall; yet <hi>that profeſſion of ſuch a different end and intention, is</hi> ſufficient for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

In the times immediately preceding the late troubles, not only the former Ceremonies of the Common-prayer booke were urged with more violence than before, but divers others quite antiquated were revived.

But why mention I <hi>Eleazar?</hi> behold the example of one greater then <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the example of the rule and patterne of holines unto the Church, Chriſt Ieſus God bleſſed for ever! whoſe example, in Morals and matters of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary obedience, amounts ever unto the authority of a command. How exemplarie he was in this particular you may reade <hi>Matth. c.</hi> 17. from <hi>v.</hi> 24, unto the end of the Chapter. There you have him performing an action, not for that omiſſion of it would have been evill, but becauſe in opinion of the Jewes, it would have given ſhew of evill. For if <hi>firſt,</hi> you underſtand the words, as moſt Interpreters do, of the tribute to be paid unto the ſecular Magiſtrate, then ſinfull it had not been in our Saviour to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed paiment of tribute unto <hi>Caeſar.</hi> For how could the Son to the living God (who was King of Kinges, and Lord of Lords, King of heaven, and earth, whoſe the earth and all the fulneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was,) be juſtly tributary unto any mortall? The <hi>Kinges</hi> of the <hi>earth take tribute, or cuſtome, not of their owne children,</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they expect obedience from them) but of <hi>ſtrangers;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe paying of tribute denoteth ſome degree, or kinde of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. <hi>The children then are free, verſ.</hi> 25, 26. Therefore from all taxes and impoſitions, juſtly was to be exempted Chriſt, the Son of <hi>David;</hi> there was no reaſon he ſhould pay tribute unto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> nay more reaſon (he being of the blood royall) ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tribute from the Jewes, than <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a forrainer, having no title to the Crowne, but that which the ſword gave him. Not paiment, conſtant denyall of paiment, had not been (you ſee) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally evill in our Saviour; and yet becauſe it would have borne
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102374:78"/>appearance of an evill, of diſloyaltie, and diſobedience, and ſo have drawn prejudices againſt, and ſcandall upon his unſpotted perſon, holy and heavenly office, and doctrine: becauſe <hi>ſeemingly</hi> it would have croſſed a doctrine he afterwards delivered, <hi>Render unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſars:</hi> therefore he ſtands not to pleade his priviledge, but voluntarily parted with his right, payed the tribute, and to pay it wrought a miracle: <hi>notwithſtanding,</hi> Peter, <hi>leſt we ſhould offend them, goe thou to the ſea, and caſt an hook, and take up the fiſh that firſt cometh up, and when thou haſt opened his mouth, thou ſhalt find a peice of money, that take, and give unto them for me and thee,</hi> verſ. 27.</p>
                     <p>Or if <hi>ſecondly,</hi> with the learned <hi>Cameron,</hi> you rather conceive to be here meant the halfe ſhekell, which by preſcript of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. was by the Jewes to be paid for the uſe of the Sanctuary. Why yet ſo alſo ſinfull it had not been in our Saviour to have refuſed paying of it: for <hi>firſt,</hi> it was a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and the Ceremoniall Law Chriſt was above, Lord he was of the Sabbath, <hi>Matth. c.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Mar. c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 28. where it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt (thinks <hi>Cameron</hi>) the Sabbath ſhould <hi>ſyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt was certainely free, and ſo might lawfully have refuſed to pay it: Yet becauſe the Iewes would have taken offence, and umbrages at ſuch his refuſall, and charg'd it with appearance of a profane contempt of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Sanctuary, therefore he voluntarily paid it, and ſo became a Jew to the Jewes, as under the Law to them that were under the Law. Notwithſtanding <hi>leſt we ſhould offend,</hi> &amp;c. And if this be the ſenſe of the place, what is ſaid of this one Ceremonie, may be applyed unto all; for one of the reaſons, and ends, why Chriſt obſerved the whole Ceremoniall Law was, to prevent ſcandall, to abſtaine from all appearance of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102374:78"/>evill. In nature (ſaith <hi>Cameron</hi>) there is, <hi>appetitus quidem unionit,</hi> which cauſeth things to be moved, and to reſt often, beſides the proper condition of their particular nature, whence ſometimes light things are moved downewards, heavie things upwards. Unto this appetite of union in nature, there is anſwerable in grace, the deſire <hi>to promote Gods glory,</hi> which often inclineth and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Godly beyond and beſides the ordinary <hi>obligations, ariſing out of their particular and perſonall condition; and relation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
                        </hi> And unto the meaſure of grace is proportionable the degree of the deſire of Gods glory, ſo that the holier any one is, the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently he deſireth the promotion thereof: and if it require any thing to be done of him, why he will do it, although otherwiſe by vertue of his particular, and perſonall condition, he be not bound thereunto. Therefore although Chriſt, <hi>ſecundum ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem rationem perſonae ſuae,</hi> if we eye the ſpeciall conſideration, and dignity of his perſon, was not tyed to keepe the Ceremoniall Law, yet he kept it, in as much as the Glory of God required him ſo to doe. If you demand how the glory of God exacted this at Chriſts hands, why Chriſt himſelfe tells us, <hi>Nè ſimus illis ſcandalo,</hi> leſt we ſhould offend them; for if Chriſt had not obſerved the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law, he had doubtleſſe wonderfully eſtranged the Jewes from him.</p>
                     <p>In obſerving it then he did but as Kings often doe in ſtooping to many things, unto which they are no waies obliged, for to win the hearts and affections of their humorous ſubjects.

But this was but a temporary injunction they gave to others. Let us view their own practice.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102374:81"/>theſe appearances of evill, to wreak his malice upon us.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> in his temptations of us to ſinne, they are, <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>baite</hi> by which he <hi>allures: Secondly,</hi> an <hi>argument</hi> by which he <hi>perſwades</hi> us thereunto. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> an <hi>encouragement,</hi> whereby he is heartned to perſiſt in tempting of us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then, the appearances of ſinne, are a <hi>baite</hi> whereby Satan allures us unto ſin, which if we bite at, our conſciences will ſoone be enlarged to ſwallow ſinne it ſelfe. Satan well knowing that Gods Children would even ſtartle at your groſſe, and more hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous ſinnes, ſuch as are, Idolatry, Adultery, Drunkenneſſe, and the like, therefore chiefly plyeth them with enticements to the ſignes, ſhewes, and occaſions of them; for theſe will ſmooth the paſſage unto the ſins themſelves. Of this we have a remarkeable inſtance in <hi>Alipius,</hi> who (as St <hi>Auſtin</hi> relates <hi>Confeſſ. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8) being drawn by his friends importunity to accompany <hi>him</hi> unto the Roman Gladiatorie Games, yet reſolveth though he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his body, to be abſent in his heart, and for that purpoſe to keep his eyes ſhut, that he might not defile them with ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a ſight: yet at laſt upon a great ſhout, that the people gave at the fall of one of the Combatants, his curioſity made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the occaſion, and thereupon he preſently became an applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpectator of that bloudy and inhumane ſpectacle. An Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, as <hi>Holerius</hi> writes, by his often ſmelling to the hearb <hi>Baſile,</hi> had a ſcorpion ingendred in his head: even ſo wee by our often dallying, and tampering with things that carry a ſhew of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, may have Satan, as I may ſo ſpeak, even formed in us, for as St <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith upon <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> the ninth, <hi>Diabolus ſerpens eſt lubricus, cujus ſi capiti, id eſt, primae ſuggeſtioni non reſiſtitur, totus interna cordis, dum non ſentitur, illabitur,</hi> that is, the Divell is a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſerpent, and if we do not keep out his head, that is, his firſt ſuggeſtions, it is not to be doubted but that he will ſtealing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlide into the moſt ſecret corners of the heart: and ſo we actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by him, ſhall at laſt proceed from things onely appearing finfull, unto the practiſe of moſt horrid and gaſtly crimes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the appearance of evill is an <hi>argument</hi> by which he perſwades us unto what is in its owne nature evill, for if a man have but ſlipt into ſuch actions as the beſt minded judge to have a reall appearance of evill, Satan forthwith will ſuggeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102374:81"/>him, that he hath by this quite crackt his credit amongſt thoſe that are accounted religious: by them (will he ſay) thou art as much ſuſpected, and as deeply cenſured for thy ſeeming evill, as for thy being ſo: wert thou not better therefore, be as thou ſeemeſt, for they cannot think worſe of thee then they doe, thy ſhame, and diſgrace, their jealouſies, ſuſpicious, and cenſures cannot be greater for ſinne it ſelfe, than it is allready for the ſhew of it. Now this temptation of Satan, receives great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from our nature, for we naturally are addicted to ſociety, and therefore if we finde that upon the ſignes and ſhewes of ſuch and ſuch ſinnes in our practiſe, good men condemne us as guilty of the ſinnes themſelves, and therefore beginne two reſerve and eſtrange themſelves from us, refuſing any longer to reach out unto us the right hand of fellowſhip, why, then we will preſently have fellowſhip with the unfruitfull workes of darkneſs, and couple in with looſe, carnall and formall men, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation will quickly infect us, ſo that it will not be long e're we runne with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot.</p>
                     <p>And thus you ſee how Satan takes occaſion from the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſinne, to draw us on unto ſinne it ſelfe, which me thinks ſhould be ſufficient to diſſwade us from them. For is Satan ſo backward in tempting, or is his invention grown ſo barren, as that our lives and practiſe muſt put arguments into his mouth? is the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of hell and damnation ſo difficult, as that we muſt needs furniſh the Divell with baits to allure us, with reaſons to perſwade us unto our everlaſting perdition, this were folly and madneſſe that would want a name.</p>
                     <p>But in the <hi>third place,</hi> the ſignes and appearances of ſinne are not only a <hi>baite,</hi> by which he <hi>enticeth</hi> us, an <hi>argument</hi> by which he perſwades unto ſinne, but withall an <hi>encouragement,</hi> by which he is heart'ned to goe on in tempting of us, for they make him ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, and hope that we are coming on to ſinne it ſelfe; and this hope will breed diligence, make him a more importunate ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter, make him to double and ſtrengthen his aſſaults, to plie us even thick and threefold with temptations: A dog will not runne from a man as long as he throwes bread unto him, and can any man ſuppoſe the Divell will flie, ſo long as he gives place unto him, as long as he throwes himſelfe upon temptations, by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102374:82"/>practiſing ſuch things as have a manifeſt ſhew of evill? for though in themſelves they be never ſo ſmall, yet will they ſerve to uſher in farther and greater matters: being then preparatives unto ſinne, they cannot be (as ſome have imagined) good fences againſt ſinne: ſeeming to be evill is not, cannot be a meanes to ſheild us from being ſo, no more then the opening the Gates of a City can be the way to raiſe the ſeige of it, or letting go the ſlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a river can be the courſe to ſtop its current.</p>

His <hi>Firſt</hi> labour is by the appearance of ſin to make us offend God, but when he cannot proceed ſo farre, his <hi>Second</hi> endeavour will be, to make us diſquiet our ſelves: when he cannot wound us by them, he will vex us for them; for he will wreſt and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue all that we have done unto the worſt ſenſe, he will ſwell motes into beames, mole-hils into mountaines, appearances of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill into realities, and thunder unto us that there is not a pinne to chooſe betwixt thoſe and theſe; unto which our ſoules beeing diſtracted by the violent importunity of this temptation, will be over apt to give credence. And for a man to be thus toſſed between Satans powerfull ſuggeſtions, and his own feares and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions cannot but even cruſh his ſpirits, and quite eclipſe the peace and joy of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Abſtinence from all appearances of evill is, <hi>thirdly,</hi> needfull in regard of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> for by them we may incurre a double danger, a <hi>danger</hi> of beeing <hi>infected with,</hi> a danger of being <hi>puniſhed for ſinne.</hi>

                        </gap> Satan is ſtrong, our luſts are ſtrong, theſe occaſions are ſutable to our luſts: our ſoules therefore, by a little helpe from Satan will quickly catch infection from them. For this reaſon were the Iſraelites, in the time of the paſſeover prohibited not onely the eating, but the very having of leavened bread in their houſes. For this reaſon too were the Nazarites forbidden to eat ſo much as the huskes of the grapes, for if that had been permitted, they would perhaps have ſoone proceeded to the eating of the grapes and thence to drinking of the wine it ſelfe: hence alſo grew that preciſe reſolution of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 101.3. <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before mine eyes:</hi> well may the world, and Divell ſet wicked things before mine eyes, but for mine own part I will not invite temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before mine eyes,</hi> as much as I can I will decline the objects, examples, and ſhewes of wickedneſſe: do but put fire unto flax, and it will preſently be on flame: ſo preſent wee unto our looſe and corrupt natures the ſhewes, (which (as you have ſeen) are alſo the occaſions of evill) and how ſuddenly will they take fire? This <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew, and therefore when his Miſtris ſollicited him to that foule act of uncleanneſſe, he harkned not unto her to lie by her, or ſo much as to be with her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.10. but fled, and got himſelfe out of her preſence, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. doubting leſt the very ſight of her might kindle luſt. Nay to the ſhame of many ſecure and venturous Chriſtians, of this even <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> an Heathen, and Souldier too, was apprehenſive and fearefull, and therefore would not ſuffer certaine captive Virgins, though of an exquiſite beauty, to be brought ſo much as into his preſence <hi>Nè quid</hi> (ſaith <hi>Florus</hi>) <hi>de virginitatis integritate delibáſſe, ſaltem vel oculis videretur.</hi> That he might not ſeeme to have ſipt, or skimmed the honour of their chaſtity, ſo much as with beholding them. As <hi>Apelles</hi> then by drawing the picture of <hi>Campaſpe</hi> fell in love with the patterne of his worke <hi>Campaſpe</hi> her ſelfe, ſo we from retaining, from affecting the ſhew of ſin, will ſoone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a delight in ſin it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Some indeed are ſo ſtrangely confident of their abhorrencie from ſinne, as they doubt not infection from appearance of it:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102374:83"/>they can venture into the looſeſt company, yet ſo bridle their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, as that they feare no exceſſe; be preſent at an Idolatrous Maſſe, and yet be in no danger of being affected with it, unleſſe it be with diſlike of it.</p>
                     <p>Surely theſe men are dropt from Heaven, never borne in ſinne, or conceived in iniquity: for they, whoſe originall is from men, may poſſibly be drawn away by ſinfull objects, and ſhewes: but theſe men (forſooth) are above <hi>gun-ſhot,</hi> beyond the reach of temptation; Their profeſſed hatred of ſinne brings me in mind of <hi>Pigmalions</hi> averſeneſſe from women; he was a profeſt, almoſt a ſworne enemie to woman kind, yet drawing but the picture of a woman, he fell in love with it, and he hug'd, and kiſt it ſo long, till at laſt by the power of <hi>Venus</hi> (as the Poët fables it) it became a woman: Their caſe is like; they profeſſe deteſtation of ſinne, and yet delight in ſome things, that have the appearance, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance thereof: let them take heed they dote not ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe, as that at length by the power of Satan, and the ſtrength of their own luſts, they be transformed into reall ſins. I will end this reaſon with that of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his fifteenth Homily unto the people of Antioch.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> as 'tis uſed vulgarly, and commonly for ſorrow, greife, diſlike, or diſpleaſure at an action, for it matters not much whether our facts be evill, or beare ſhew of evill, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually would wound the hearts, and vexe the righteous ſpirits of the Godly, and therefore are both violations of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2. Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification. <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> (ſaith <hi>Florus</hi>) <hi>nè ſpecie arcis offenderet, eminentes aedes ſuas in planâ ſubmiſit:</hi> he levelled with the ground his high and lofty building, leſt he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the people with the appearance of a Cittadell: and wilt not thou throw aſide a vanity, an excrement, ſome idle if not mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous faſhion, rather than offend thy brother (for whom Chriſt died) with the appearance of an evil? A foule ſhame were it, that <hi>popularity</hi> ſhould prevaile more with a Roman, than <hi>Charity</hi> with thee, who art a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will be ready to <hi>object,</hi> that this doctrine is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to our Chriſtian liberty. For that reacheth to the uſe of all things that are of an indifferent nature, and ſuch are theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons charged with the appearance of evill, and therefore if you ſtreighten us in the uſe of them, you injuriouſly deprive us of that liberty which we have in Chriſt Jeſus unto the uſe of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things. For <hi>anſwer,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> thoſe actions, in which there is a reall appearance of evill, are not indifferent in their nature, but evill, and ſinfull, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <hi>firſt, by the</hi> generall prohibition of ſcandall, they are <hi>per ſe</hi> ſcandalous of themſelves and in their own nature, and therefore <hi>allwaies,</hi> for <hi>à per ſe ad de omni valet argumentum:</hi> prohibited, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> by thoſe precepts which are againſt thoſe evils of which they have a reall appearance, becauſe they are a ſtep unto, and occaſion of them, <hi>whereas</hi> 'tis uſually ſaid that they are evill <hi>only in appearance,</hi> this is not to be underſtood ſo as to <hi>exclude evill from them,</hi> but <hi>to reſtraine the evill of them</hi> unto this <hi>particular:</hi> that they have a reall appearance of evill, the meaning is, they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102374:84"/>are evill in no regard but this, and this regard, for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid, is ſufficient to denominate them evill: they are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies temptations unto evill, ſo that there is allwaies committed in them an active ſcandall. This was the opinion of the vulgar tranſlater, who tranſlates, 1 <hi>Theſ. v.</hi> 22. <hi>ab omni ſpecie malaâ abſtinete vos,</hi> abſtaine from every evill appearance, this reading <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> and other Popiſh Expoſitors think equivalent with our tranſlation <hi>abſtaine from all appearance of evill,</hi> according to it then every appearance of evill is evill, if it be reall and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imaginary. Unto this let me adde that of <hi>Suarez</hi> allready quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, an action, ſaith he, onely evill in appearance tranſgreſſeth ſome virtue, though not <hi>per ſe primo,</hi> yet <hi>ex conſequenti connexione virtutum,</hi> by reaſon of the mutuall connexion and commerce of one virtue with, and dependance upon another.</p>
                     <p>But to come to, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> thoſe indifferent actions in which there is only an imaginary appearance of evill, two things are here to be anſwered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> however they be in <hi>theſi</hi> in their generall nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, yet they do in <hi>caſu</hi> and in <hi>hypotheſi</hi> become to be acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally evill, becauſe done againſt <hi>Conſcience,</hi> when they appeare to be evill to our ſelves; <hi>againſt charity,</hi> when they appeare to be evill unto others: and then we are bound to abſtaine from them, though not <hi>lege communi,</hi> yet <hi>lege particulari,</hi> by reaſon of particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although our Chriſtian liberty extendeth to the uſe of all things indifferent, yet ought we in godly wiſdome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to abridge our ſelves of the outward exerciſe of this our liberty, whenſoever 'tis very probable that it will become <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> to our ſelves, or <hi>ſcandalous to others. Ye have been called unto liberty, only uſe not liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another, Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloake of malitiouſneſſe,</hi> the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. Now we uſe or rather abuſe our liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, for a cloake to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſneſſe, by practiſing ſuch indifferencies, as have ſhew of evill; for they, (as I have ſhewen at large) are likely to prove, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne unto our ſelves, ſo alſo active ſcandalls to miſguide our brethren, and therefore, though they be not <hi>abſolutely, and ſimply in their nature unlawfull to be done,</hi> yet they are by <hi>accident</hi>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:102374:85"/>unlawfull for me to doe, as long as they carry ſhew of evill. <hi>All things</hi> (indeed) <hi>are pure (ſaith the Apoſtle) but it is evill for that man, who eateth with offence: It is good neither to eat fleſh, nor drinke wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weake, Rom.</hi> 14.20, 21.

We are to abſtaine neither <hi>only nor chiefly</hi> from the appearance of evill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> not <hi>only,</hi> that were foule <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> of which yet there are even a generation guilty, who only combate with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of ſinne, and in the meane while embrace the body of ſinne, reall ſinnes: who abſtaine from the ſhew of every evill worke, and yet remaine reprobate to every good worke, who profeſſe deſtation of gaine by gaiming, becauſe they conceive it to be an appearance of theft, and yet make no conſcience of fraud, deceit, and couſenage in their dealings, who ſtand at defiance with all ſhewes of uncleaneſſe, and yet make no ſcruple of the groſſeſt acts thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> not <hi>chiefly,</hi> that were a great incongruity, for ſo care of the meanes ſhould be greater than that of the end, becauſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from the appearance of evill, is enjoyned as a preſervative againſt the evill it ſelfe. The evils themſelves therefore ſhould cheifely be avoided, the body of ſin ſhould be oppoſed more than the ſhadow, than the ſhewes of ſin. The fleſh ſhould be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a higher degree, than the garment ſpotted therewith.</p>

                     <p>You have ſeene the point preſt generally as it concernes all mens abſtinence from the appearance of all evils. I will only crave your pardon to call more particularly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> upon <hi>all men</hi> for abſtinence from the appearance eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>ſome evills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> upon <hi>ſome men</hi> eſpecially for abſtinence from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>all evills,</hi> and then I will put a period to my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt decline the ſhewes of ſome evils above others, of our <hi>Maſter,</hi> our <hi>boſome evils.</hi> For from them is moſt danger to be feared, they having commonly moſt ſtrengh from our natures: and Satan beſides knowes but too well how our tide ſtands, he quickly acquaints himſelfe with our predominant luſts, and moſt raging corruptions, and unto them eſpecially fits and accords his temptations: as
<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Tacitus, Suetonius.</note> 
                        <hi>Agrippina,</hi> when ſhe poiſoned her husband <hi>Claudius,</hi> mixed the poiſon in the meat which he moſt loved.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>ſome men</hi> above others are eſpecially to decline the appearance of <hi>all evils.</hi> All publick men ſhould do ſo, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we of the Miniſtry. <hi>The high Prieſts and Nazarites, under the Law were not to come nigh a dead body, Lev.</hi> 21.11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.6. And in imitation of them among the Romans, the Prieſt might not touch the dead, nay they might not ſee the dead: for if a Prieſt pronounced a Funerall Oration, 'twas not without a veile drawn betwixt him and the Corps. Nay a Flaminian Prieſt might not heare the ſound of pipes uſed at Funerals nor come into a place where there was a grave. Was theere ſuch <hi>rituall</hi> purity under the Law? ſuch <hi>Ceremoniall ſtrictneſſe</hi> in heatheniſh Prieſts? and ſhall there not be found an anſwerable degree of <hi>morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe</hi> in the miniſters of the Goſpell? ſhall they be willingly within ſight, ſent, and hearing of impiety, except to reprove it?

If he be but innocently pleaſant, think they we may be mad. If he but ſip, we may carouſe. If he ſpend but ſome few houres, in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and harmeleſſe recreations, the common gameſter preſently concludes his miſpenſe of both time, and patrimony in gaming to be thence juſtifiable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> more <hi>heavineſſe to good ones:</hi> it grieves the ſpirits of the righteous to ſee them in any, it wounds their ſoules, it makes their bloods, their hearts riſe to behold them in a man of God. It becomes not my weakneſſe to adviſe, only in mine own and others behalfe, I unfainedly wiſh, and pray, that this were ſeriouſly thought upon, and practiſed by us all, that all of us in a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the reputation, and honour of our high calling would walke with great ſurcumſpection, make ſtrait ſteps unto our feet, tread every ſtep as nicely, as gingerly, as if we went among ſnares, walked upon ropes, or pinnacles.</p>
